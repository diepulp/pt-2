## Canonical Reference

The **TableContextService** is the primary bounded context for gaming table operations, documented in:
- [SRM §1275-1579](../../docs/20-architecture/SERVICE_RESPONSIBILITY_MATRIX.md)
- [table-context/README.md](../table-context/README.md)

If this directory contains utilities or shared table logic, it should be documented here. Otherwise, prefer using `table-context` for all table-related bounded context operations.
