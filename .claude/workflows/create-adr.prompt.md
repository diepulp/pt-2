# Create ADR Workflow

## Overview

This workflow creates Architecture Decision Records following PT-2 standards with systematic analysis and alternatives evaluation.

**Estimated Time**: 45-90 minutes (analysis ‚Üí ADR creation ‚Üí documentation)

**Outcome**: Production-ready ADR with comprehensive rationale and memory updates

---

## Phase 1: Decision Analysis (Architect Mode)

**Chatmode**: `architect.chatmode.md`
**Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob, sequential-thinking MCP
**Output**: Analysis + ADR document

### Step 1.1: Understand Decision Context

**Gather Information**:

1. **Problem Statement**: What decision needs to be made?
2. **Constraints**: What limitations exist (technical, business, time)?
3. **Stakeholders**: Who is affected by this decision?
4. **Current State**: What is the existing approach (if any)?
5. **Success Criteria**: How will we know this decision was correct?

**Load Context**:

```
- Review .claude/memory/architecture-decisions.memory.md
- Review .claude/memory/project-context.memory.md
- Review existing ADRs in docs/adr/
- Review relevant sections of PRD
```

### Step 1.2: Systematic Analysis with Sequential Thinking

**Use**: `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`

**Analysis Framework**:

```
üîç Sequential Thinking: ADR Analysis

Thought 1: Problem Definition
- What exactly are we deciding?
- Why does this decision matter now?
- What happens if we don't decide?

Thought 2: Current State Assessment
- What is the current approach (if any)?
- What problems does it create?
- What constraints does it impose?

Thought 3: Requirements Gathering
- What are the must-have requirements?
- What are the nice-to-have features?
- What are the non-negotiable constraints?

Thought 4: Option Generation
- What are ALL possible approaches?
- Include both conventional and unconventional options
- Don't pre-filter based on perceived viability

Thought 5: Option Analysis (For Each Option)
- Pros: What are the advantages?
- Cons: What are the disadvantages?
- Risks: What could go wrong?
- Effort: What is the implementation cost?
- Alignment: How well does it fit PT-2?

Thought 6: Comparative Evaluation
- Which option best meets requirements?
- Which option has lowest risk?
- Which option aligns with PT-2 principles?
- What are the key trade-offs?

Thought 7: Recommendation Synthesis
- What is the recommended approach?
- Why is it better than alternatives?
- What are the key trade-offs accepted?
- What mitigations address the downsides?

Thought 8: Validation
- Does this align with existing ADRs?
- Does this align with PRD constraints?
- Does this follow PT-2 architecture patterns?
- Are consequences clearly understood?
```

**Output**: Structured analysis with clear recommendation

### Step 1.3: Generate ADR Number

```bash
# List existing ADRs
ls -1 docs/adr/ | grep '^ADR-' | sort -V | tail -1

# Example output: ADR-003-state-management-strategy.md
# Next number: ADR-004
```

### Step 1.4: Create ADR Document

**Format**: `docs/adr/ADR-{number}-{kebab-case-title}.md`

**Template**:

```markdown
# ADR-{number}: {Title}

**Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
**Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Deciders**: {Team/Role}
**Related ADRs**: {list if any}

## Common ADR Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Technology Choice ADR

**Example**: "Should we use React Query or SWR for server state?"

**Analysis Focus**:

- Feature comparison
- Performance characteristics
- Developer experience
- Ecosystem maturity
- PT-2 alignment

### Scenario 2: Architecture Pattern ADR

**Example**: "Should we use HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL architecture for feature X?"

**Analysis Focus**:

- Bounded context analysis
- SERVICE_RESPONSIBILITY_MATRIX review
- BALANCED_ARCHITECTURE_QUICK framework
- Over-engineering guardrail check

### Scenario 3: Process/Workflow ADR

**Example**: "How should we handle database migrations?"

**Analysis Focus**:

- Current pain points
- Developer workflow impact
- Type safety implications
- Automation opportunities

### Scenario 4: Reversal ADR

**Example**: "Reverse ADR-002 test location strategy"

**Process**:

1. Create new ADR superseding old one
2. Explain why original decision no longer valid
3. Document new approach
4. Update old ADR status to "Superseded by ADR-XXX"

---

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Identify Alternatives

**Symptoms**: Only one approach considered
**Action**: Use sequential thinking to brainstorm, research similar projects
**Minimum**: Must have 2 alternatives with clear rejection rationale

### Decision Unclear

**Symptoms**: Rationale weak, multiple interpretations possible
**Action**: Return to problem statement, use sequential thinking
**Goal**: Single sentence decision statement

### Consequences Uncertain

**Symptoms**: Risks not identified, impact unclear
**Action**: Deeper analysis, consult existing ADRs for precedent
**Tool**: Sequential thinking for systematic consequence analysis

### Implementation Plan Missing

**Symptoms**: ADR approved but no clear next steps
**Action**: Break down into phases, assign owners, set deadlines
**Format**: Phased approach with success criteria

---

## Success Metrics

**Quality**:

- Clear decision statement
- ‚â•2 alternatives with rejection rationale
- Consequences documented (positive + negative)
- Risks identified with mitigations
- Implementation plan with success criteria

**Process**:

- 45-90 minutes total
- Sequential thinking analysis
- 1 validation gate

- ‚ùå Missing consequences section
- ‚ùå No implementation plan
- ‚ùå Contradicts existing ADRs without explanation
- ‚ùå Generic/vague decision statement
- ‚ùå Risks not identified
- ‚ùå Alternatives without rejection rationale
- ‚ùå Skipping sequential thinking for complex decisions
