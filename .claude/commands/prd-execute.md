# PRD Execute — DEPRECATED

**`prd-pipeline` has been superseded by `build-pipeline`.** This command redirects to `/build`.

## Action

**Invoke `build-pipeline` skill via the Skill tool:**

```
Skill(skill="build-pipeline", args="$ARGUMENTS")
```

All input formats accepted by the old prd-pipeline (`PRD-XXX`, file paths, `--resume`, `EXEC-SPEC-XXX`) are supported by build-pipeline with identical resolution logic.
