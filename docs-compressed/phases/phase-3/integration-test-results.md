Infrastructure Validation Phase 3 Components Tested use operations return structured ServiceResult<T> PostgreSQL errors codes Database types services Referential integrity database Duplicate data prevention Service Architecture Standards Validated Functional factory pattern classes Explicit interfaces ReturnType inference Typed supabase parameters Proper DTO naming separation

Issues Found Resolved Issues Discovered Interface used incorrect field names Service interfaces evolved assumptions older API Updated test calls match DTOs No service changes tests match interfaces Enum RESOLVED uppercase enum valuesdatabase enums_in_out Updated enum references match database schema Tests use lowercase enum values Required MTL requires `tenderType `recordedByEmployeeId RatingSlip `playerId Staff table requires `updatedAt Updated test data required fields validation required field constraints MTL references Created Staff records role enum testing Confirmed FK relationships database schema Code FK violations return error `23502 instead UUID fields non entities trigger NULL constraint before Updated error expectations accept `23502 data errors robust error handling tests

Performance Observations Test ~750ms Cross-service~2.4s operations NOT_FOUND error tests~200ms data No latency No connection pool exhaustion

Data Integrity Validation FK constraints Unique constraints email constraints Cascade behavior Timestamp fields-populated UUID generation keys

Quality Gates Status 6 services pass CRUD tests 24/24 tests Cross-service workflow validated 2/2 tests Error handling 6/6 tests No issues Week 4 no blockers

Phase 2 Cleanup tests pass minor improvements Phase 2 services Error Code Some services map `23502 errors Add `23502`mapping handling lack JSDoc comments Add JSDoc DTOs improves developer experience Data Tests create data clean Add cleanup`afterEach CASCADE deletes transaction rollback results database hygiene
