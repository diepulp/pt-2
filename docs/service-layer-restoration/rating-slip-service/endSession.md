# RatingSlip Service Remediation Report – `endSession`

## Context
- Artifact under review: `services/ratingslip` (CRUD + service factory)
- Canonical reference: `docs/patterns/SERVICE_RESPONSIBILITY_MATRIX.md` (v2.5.0)
- Related guidance: service orchestration snippet that calls `ratingSlipService.endSession()` before delegating to Loyalty, then caches points back on the slip.

## Current Gaps
1. No dedicated `endSession` helper exists. Consumers must call the generic `update()` method, which does not enforce lifecycle rules, compute duration, or guard against double-closing.
2. `RatingSlipDTO` (and corresponding selects) drop two mandated fields:
   - `game_settings`, needed so Loyalty can calculate rewards.
   - `points`, the denormalised cache that must be writable via `update()` after Loyalty returns.
3. Supabase type definitions were not regenerated after the remediation workflow, so `points` is still omitted from the generated `ratingslip` shape. This blocks the code changes above from compiling.

## Remediation Plan
1. **Introduce `endSession`**
   - Implement `endSession(id)` in `services/ratingslip/index.ts` / `crud.ts`.
   - Behaviour: refuse to close an already-closed slip, compute `end_time`, `status = 'closed'`, `accumulated_seconds` using `start_time` ± `pause_intervals`, and return the full telemetry payload.
2. **Restore DTO coverage**
   - Extend `RatingSlipDTO` and query selections to include `game_settings` and `points` (read-only cache).
   - Allow `RatingSlipUpdateDTO` to accept `points` so the Loyalty orchestration can persist the denormalised cache after calculation.
3. **Regenerate Supabase types**
   - Run `npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id <id> --schema public > types/database.types.ts` (or equivalent) so `ratingslip` reflects the new schema (including `points`).
4. **Dependents**
   - Update any tests or server actions to call the new `endSession` helper and assert `points` round-trips correctly.

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Unit tests cover `endSession` happy-path, double-close rejection, and telemetry payload.
- [ ] Integration test demonstrates the full orchestration: `endSession` → Loyalty → `update(id, { points })`.
- [ ] `npm run lint` and `npm run test` pass.
- [ ] `docs/patterns/SERVICE_RESPONSIBILITY_MATRIX.md` references (lines ~900-960) are satisfied: *RatingSlip caches result* and exposes `game_settings`.

## Open Questions
- None. The referenced guidance explicitly requires a specialised `endSession` helper; this report follows that contract.
