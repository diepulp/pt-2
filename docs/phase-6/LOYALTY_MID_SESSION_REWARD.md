ü™ô Loyalty Service ‚Äî Mid-Session Reward Update Strategy
Problem

Your base design emits RatingSlipCompleted ‚Üí LoyaltyService ‚Üí accrues points at session end.
However, you now need the ability to:

‚úÖ Issue or adjust loyalty points while a session is still active ‚Äî e.g., for real-time bonuses, promos, or staff overrides.

Principle

Keep LoyaltyService as the sole authority for points mutation,
but allow RatingSlipService (or any authorized domain) to emit interim events ‚Äî not to compute, but to request accrual.

In DDD terms: ‚ÄúDomain events may be triggered at different lifecycle points, but the policy execution remains centralized.‚Äù

Approach Overview

| Concern                         | Solution                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maintain event-driven integrity | Keep events as triggers for all accruals.                        |
| Allow in-session updates        | Add a ‚Äúprovisional points‚Äù pathway.                              |
| Prevent double-counting         | Use `session_id` + `source_type` to uniquely key ledger entries. |
| Ensure idempotency              | `UPSERT` or deduplicate by composite keys.                       |

## Event Model
**Existing**

```json
{
  "type": "RATINGS_SLIP_COMPLETED",
  "data": { "playerId": "...", "averageBet": 200, "durationMinutes": 45 }
}

```

**New (In-Session Event)**

```json
{
  "type": "POINTS_UPDATE_REQUESTED",
  "data": {
    "playerId": "...",
    "sessionId": "...",
    "points": 300,
    "reason": "Mid-session bonus",
    "source": "manual" // or "promotion", "system"
  }
}
```

## Loyalty Service Handling
1. Unified Handler

Both end-of-session and mid-session events funnel through the same accruePoints pipeline.

```ts
// loyaltyService.ts
export async function accruePoints(event: PointsEvent) {
  const { playerId, points, sessionId, reason } = event.data;
  await ledger.insertUnique({
    player_id: playerId,
    session_id: sessionId,
    event_type: event.type,
    points_change: points,
    reason,
  });
  await playerLoyalty.updateBalance(playerId, points);
}
```

The insertUnique() ensures no duplicate accruals per event source.

2. Direct Invocation (Authorized Path)

Sometimes, event emission may be overkill (e.g., quick manual reward).
You can allow staff-facing tools to call the same logic directly:

```ts
await loyaltyService.manualReward({
  playerId,
  points: 200,
  reason: "Supervisor bonus",
  sessionId: currentSessionId,
});
```

3. Schema Adjustments
Loyalty Ledger:

```sql
ALTER TABLE loyalty_ledger
ADD COLUMN session_id UUID,
ADD COLUMN reason TEXT,
ADD COLUMN source TEXT DEFAULT 'system';
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON loyalty_ledger (session_id, event_type, source);
```

This enables mid-session accruals without double-counting at session close.

```

5. Anti-Pattern Avoidance
Anti-Pattern	Fix
RatingSlip updates loyalty balance directly	‚ùå Not allowed ‚Äî emit event or call service
Multiple services writing to ledger	‚ùå LoyaltyService only
Mid-session points stored in RatingSlip	‚ùå Store all in loyalty_ledger with session link
Separate ‚Äúbonus‚Äù ledger	‚ùå Keep unified ledger; use reason/source metadata

6. Implementation Notes

Session closure logic should still emit a final event (e.g., aggregate metrics).

Loyalty Service should ignore duplicates based on session_id + event_type + source.

The balance field in player_loyalty is always authoritative ‚Äî recalculated from the ledger if needed.

| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |

| Mid-session issuance   | `POINTS_UPDATE_REQUESTED` event or `manualReward()` call |
| Source of truth        | `loyalty_ledger`                                         |
| Coupling               | Loose ‚Äî all updates via events or service method         |
| Duplication control    | Composite index (session_id, event_type, source)         |
| Triggering contexts    | RatingSlip, StaffPanel, PromotionEngine                  |

üì¶ Implementation Order

Extend loyalty_ledger schema (session_id, reason, source).

Add unified accruePoints() handler.

Add manualReward() wrapper.

Register event listeners for:

RATINGS_SLIP_COMPLETED

POINTS_UPDATE_REQUESTED

Update player_loyalty on each accrual.

üßÆ Mid-Session Reward ‚Üí Total Points Update Flow
1. Data Source of Truth

loyalty_ledger ‚Äî immutable event log of all point deltas.
Every accrual or reward (system or manual) is recorded here.

player_loyalty.total_points ‚Äî cached aggregate, always derived from the ledger.

2. When a Mid-Session Reward Is Issued
Event emitted or API call:

```json
{
  "type": "POINTS_UPDATE_REQUESTED",
  "data": {
    "playerId": "uuid",
    "sessionId": "uuid",
    "points": 200,
    "reason": "Supervisor bonus",
    "source": "manual"
  }
}
```
LoyaltyService handles it:
```ts
// loyalty/business/accrual.ts
export async function accruePoints(event: PointsEvent) {
  const { playerId, sessionId, points, reason, source } = event.data;

  // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Log in ledger
  await supabase.from("loyalty_ledger").insert({
    player_id: playerId,
    session_id: sessionId,
    event_type: event.type,
    points_change: points,
    reason,
    source,
  });

  // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Increment cached total + tier progress
  await supabase.rpc("increment_player_loyalty", {
    player_id: playerId,
    delta_points: points,
  });
}
```

3. Total Points Adjustment Logic
Option A ‚Äî Materialized View (recalculated nightly)

Rebuild totals from ledger for integrity.

Ideal for analytics and anti-fraud verification.

Option B ‚Äî Live Update (preferred for PT runtime)

Use a lightweight RPC or SQL trigger:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment_player_loyalty(player_id UUID, delta_points INT)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE player_loyalty
  SET total_points = total_points + delta_points,
      tier_progress = calculate_tier_progress(total_points + delta_points),
      last_update = now()
  WHERE player_id = increment_player_loyalty.player_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
This keeps player_loyalty always accurate, even mid-session.

4. Session End

When the RATINGS_SLIP_COMPLETED event arrives:

Loyalty simply adds the remaining earned points.

Since mid-session bonuses already exist in the ledger, they are additive ‚Äî no overwrite or re-calc needed.

| Step                      | Description                                 | Effect                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Mid-session reward issued | Event or manual call                        | Inserts new ledger row        |
| Ledger insert             | Adds immutable entry                        | Preserves audit               |
| RPC update                | Increments total_points & recalculates tier | Keeps player snapshot current |
| End-session accrual       | Adds final earned points                    | Completes session accounting  |

‚úÖ Final Behavior

Player sees real-time point increase.

Ledger remains the single source of truth.

No duplication at session close.

Tier logic automatically re-evaluates on each increment.
