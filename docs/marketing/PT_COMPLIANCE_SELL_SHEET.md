# PT Title 31 Compliance Support — One‑Page Sell Sheet
*Audience:* Compliance Officers, General Managers, Surveillance / Audit stakeholders  
*Positioning:* **Operational compliance support + evidence trail** (not a filing replacement by default)

---

## What PT is
**Player Tracker (PT)** is a casino operations platform that captures **pit + cage activity** as a structured, attributable record—built to support **Title 31 / FinCEN** workflows (CTRC/SAR/MTL) and withstand audits.

## What PT is not (by default)
- Not a guaranteed “we make you compliant” product (compliance is program + people + procedures).
- Not necessarily an e‑filing replacement (CTRC/SAR filing can integrate later).
- Not a cage/accounting system of record (PT produces **supporting evidence** and operational logs).

## Compliance‑relevant capabilities

### 1) Currency activity capture (pit + cage), gaming‑day aware
- Records currency events with **cash‑in vs cash‑out** semantics aligned to Title 31.
- Aggregates activity by **gaming day** and patron to support CTRC thresholds.
- Enforces the rule: **cash‑in and cash‑out are tracked separately (no offset).**

### 2) MTL‑style operational log + accountability
- MTL‑style entries with staff attribution (who/when/where/why).
- Threshold‑driven logging (configure your local “MTL/minimum log” thresholds and escalation).
- Designed to be searchable and reviewable (shift/daybook workflow).

### 3) SAR‑ready evidence spine
- Captures structured notes/events supporting suspicious activity review.
- Retains an audit‑friendly trail suitable for “supporting documentation” expectations.

### 4) Control‑aligned RBAC/RLS (segregation of duties)
- Separates **operational observations** (pit) from **settlement authority** (cage/finance).
- Role‑scoped permissions reduce “everyone can do everything” risk.

### 5) Audit & reporting surfaces for GMs
- Shift dashboards show:
  - directional cash totals (in/out),
  - threshold approach/cross events,
  - exception notes and acknowledgements.
- Exportable reporting surfaces for internal reviews and external audits.

## Operational telemetry that stakeholders actually want (without breaking controls)
**Walk‑With / Chips Taken (Operational Observation)**
- Pit records **amount estimate** when chips move off table.
- Separately records “cage‑confirmed” numbers when/if confirmed (phone / follow‑up).
- Observation ≠ settlement: PT preserves both numbers when they differ (audit clarity).

---

## Outcomes you can expect
- Faster, more consistent CTRC/SAR review because evidence isn’t scattered across paper logs and ad‑hoc notes.
- Fewer “we knew it happened but can’t prove it” moments during audits.
- Cleaner shift reporting and cross‑team alignment (pit ↔ cage ↔ compliance) without collapsing roles.

---

## Standards & regulatory alignment (why this language is safe)
PT aligns to the *operational data* implied by Title 31:
- CTRC triggers: transactions in currency involving **cash‑in or cash‑out > $10,000**.  
- AML program expectations: internal controls + independent testing (program design).  
- SAR expectations: maintain SAR copy + supporting documentation.  
- FinCEN guidance: cash‑in and cash‑out must not be offset; aggregate by gaming day.

## Quick FAQ (for buyers)
**Do you file CTRC/SAR for us?**  
Not by default. PT provides the structured evidence trail and operational logs that make filing and audits defensible; filing integrations can be added.

**Does PT replace our cage/accounting system?**  
No. PT’s job is the operational record and evidence backbone—especially across pit activity and shift reporting.

**Can we configure local thresholds (e.g., MTL log at $3k)?**  
Yes. PT supports configurable thresholds and state changes (approaching / crossed) for operational escalation.
