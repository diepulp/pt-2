## Wave-by-Wave Summary

### Wave 1: Server Actions ✅
**Duration**: Completed in single session
**Agent**: Backend Architect
**Deliverable**: [app/actions/player-actions.ts](../../app/actions/player-actions.ts)

**Implementation**:
- ✅ `createPlayer(data: PlayerCreateDTO)` → ServiceResult<PlayerDTO>
- ✅ `updatePlayer(id: string, data: PlayerUpdateDTO)` → ServiceResult<PlayerDTO>
- ✅ `deletePlayer(id: string)` → ServiceResult<void>
- ✅ `getPlayer(id: string)` → ServiceResult<PlayerDTO>
- ✅ `getPlayers()` → ServiceResult<PlayerDTO[]>
- ✅ `searchPlayers(query: string)` → ServiceResult<PlayerDTO[]>

**Quality Gates (6/6)**:
- ✅ All 6 server actions implemented
- ✅ Each wrapped with withServerAction
- ✅ Supabase client created properly
- ✅ TypeScript types match service layer
- ✅ JSDoc comments complete
- ✅ No compilation errors

**Error Coverage**:
- VALIDATION_ERROR (23514, 23502)
- UNIQUE_VIOLATION (23505) - Duplicate email
- FOREIGN_KEY_VIOLATION (23503)
- NOT_FOUND (PGRST116)
- INTERNAL_ERROR (500)

---

### Wave 2: Query + Mutation Hooks ✅
**Duration**: Parallel execution (Query + Mutation tracks)
**Agents**: 2x TypeScript Pro (conceptual parallel execution)
**Deliverables**: 6 hooks in [hooks/player/](../../hooks/player/)

#### Track A: Query Hooks
- ✅ [use-player.ts](../../hooks/player/use-player.ts) - Single player query
- ✅ [use-players.ts](../../hooks/player/use-players.ts) - List all players
- ✅ [use-player-search.ts](../../hooks/player/use-player-search.ts) - Search players

**Query Key Patterns (ADR-003 compliant)**:
- Detail: `['player', 'detail', id]`
- List: `['player', 'list']`
- Search: `['player', 'search', query]`

**Stale Time Strategy**:
- Details: 5 minutes (infrequent changes)
- Lists: 2 minutes (fresher data)
- Search: 30 seconds (rapid changes)

#### Track B: Mutation Hooks
- ✅ [use-create-player.ts](../../hooks/player/use-create-player.ts) - Create mutation
- ✅ [use-update-player.ts](../../hooks/player/use-update-player.ts) - Update mutation
- ✅ [use-delete-player.ts](../../hooks/player/use-delete-player.ts) - Delete mutation

**Cache Invalidation Strategies (ADR-003)**:
- **Create**: Domain-level invalidation (`['player']`)
- **Update**: Granular invalidation (detail + lists)
- **Delete**: Query removal (removeQueries + invalidate lists)

**Quality Gates (8/8)**:
- ✅ All 3 query hooks implemented
- ✅ Query keys follow documented pattern
- ✅ TypeScript inference works correctly
- ✅ Hooks integrate with useServiceQuery template
- ✅ All 3 mutation hooks implemented
- ✅ Cache invalidation strategies applied correctly
- ✅ TypeScript generics work
- ✅ Hooks integrate with useServiceMutation template

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅
1. **Wave-based execution** - Clear structure enabled systematic progress
2. **Infrastructure validation** - Extended player service before starting Wave 1
3. **Hook templates** - Week 3 templates accelerated Wave 2 implementation
4. **Comprehensive testing** - 22 tests caught integration issues early
5. **Type safety** - TypeScript prevented runtime errors throughout

### Challenges Overcome ✅
1. **Missing prerequisites** - Extended player service with delete/list/search methods
2. **Path differences** - Found withServerAction in lib/server-actions/ (not lib/actions/)
3. **Test framework** - Used Jest for integration tests, Cypress for browser tests
4. **Database types** - Player table schema different from workflow (email vs player_code)

### Adaptations Made ✅
1. **Schema alignment** - Used actual database schema (email, firstName, lastName)
2. **File structure** - Respected existing lib/ directory organization
3. **Test approach** - Dual strategy (Jest + Cypress) for comprehensive coverage
4. **Component design** - Used shadcn/ui components for consistency

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 5)
1. Review Phase 4 lessons learned
2. Update patterns based on player management experience
3. Begin **Phase 5: Visit Tracking Feature** (next VERTICAL slice)
4. Apply same wave structure with improvements

### Phase 5 Preview
**Deliverable**: Visit Tracking Feature
- Wave 1: Visit server actions (startVisit, endVisit, getVisit, listVisits)
- Wave 2: Visit hooks (parallel - queries + mutations)
- Wave 3: Visit UI components (visit-form, visit-list, visit-status)
- Wave 4: E2E tests (visit lifecycle)

**Estimated Duration**: 15-16 hours (similar to Phase 4)

### Integration Opportunities
1. Add player management to CI/CD pipeline
2. Create Storybook stories for components
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Implement analytics tracking
5. Create user documentation
