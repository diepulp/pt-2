# Phase 0 Implementation Summary

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Date**: 2025-10-02
**PRD Alignment**: Sections 3.10 (Testing), 4 (Anti-Patterns)

---

## What Was Delivered

Phase 0 establishes the **minimalistic safety net** for PT-2 development:

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline ✅
- Single GitHub Actions workflow: [.github/workflows/ci.yml](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- Quality gates: lint → type-check → test → build → e2e
- Runtime: <5min (targeting <2min for unit tests per PRD)
- **Acceptance**: Pipeline runs on every push/PR

### 2. Pre-Commit Hooks ✅
- Husky integration: [.husky/pre-commit](../../.husky/pre-commit)
- Lint-staged: Auto-format and lint only staged files
- **Acceptance**: Commits blocked if linting fails

### 3. Testing Infrastructure ✅
**Jest + React Testing Library**:
- Config: [jest.config.js](../../jest.config.js), [jest.setup.js](../../jest.setup.js)
- Utilities: Mock Supabase client, custom render helpers
- Scripts: `test`, `test:watch`, `test:coverage`, `test:ci`

**Cypress E2E**:
- Config: [cypress.config.ts](../../cypress.config.ts)
- Support: Custom commands, Testing Library integration
- Scripts: `cypress`, `cypress:headless`, `e2e`, `e2e:headless`

**Acceptance**: Tests run successfully, coverage reporting enabled

### 4. Anti-Pattern Enforcement ✅
**ESLint Rules** ([eslint.config.mjs](../../eslint.config.mjs)):
- ❌ `console.log` in production (allow `warn`/`error` only)
- ❌ `as any` type casting
- ❌ `test.only` / `describe.only` (prevent CI accidents)
- ❌ Supabase client creation in components/stores
- ❌ ReturnType inference for services

**Service Layer Rules** ([.eslintrc-services.js](../../.eslintrc-services.js)):
- ❌ Class-based services (enforce functional factories)
- ❌ Default exports (enforce named exports)
- ❌ Global real-time managers (enforce hook-scoped subscriptions)
- ❌ `@deprecated` code (delete instead of maintaining)
- ✅ Explicit return types for service factories

**Acceptance**: Lint fails on anti-pattern violations

### 5. Security Skeleton (Phase 1) ✅
**Migrations** (saved in [supabase/migrations/](../../supabase/migrations/)):

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `20251002010000_enable_rls.sql` | Enable RLS on core tables + owner policy for player | ⏳ Pending execution |
| `20251002020000_jwt_helpers.sql` | `staff_role` enum + `jwt_get_role()` stub | ⏳ Pending execution |
| `20251002030000_audit_log_scaffold.sql` | `audit_log` table + empty trigger | ⏳ Pending execution |
| `20251002040000_compliance_table_stubs.sql` | `mtl_entry` + `casino_settings` stubs | ⏳ Pending execution |

**Execution Instructions**: [supabase/migrations/README.md](../../supabase/migrations/README.md)

**Acceptance**:
- ✅ Migrations written and documented
- ⏳ User must execute via Supabase Dashboard or psql
- ⏳ Then run `npm run db:types` to regenerate types

## Acceptance Criteria (PRD Compliance)

### Phase 0: CI/CD Foundation ✅
- [x] Single CI workflow file (not over-engineered)
- [x] 4 quality gates: lint, type-check, test, build
- [x] Pre-commit hooks via Husky
- [x] Lint-staged for fast feedback
- [x] All npm scripts defined: `test`, `test:ci`, `e2e`, `lint`

### Phase 1: Security Skeleton ✅ (Pending Execution)
- [x] RLS enabled on all core tables
- [x] One working policy (player owner-only)
- [x] JWT helper stub (returns SUPERVISOR)
- [x] `audit_log`, `mtl_entry`, `casino_settings` tables scaffolded
- [ ] User executes migrations (next step)
- [ ] Types regenerated via `npm run db:types` (after migrations)

### Testing & Anti-Patterns ✅
- [x] Jest configured with Next.js integration
- [x] React Testing Library utilities
- [x] Cypress E2E framework ready
- [x] ESLint anti-pattern rules enforced
- [x] Service layer linting rules
- [x] Coverage reporting enabled
- [x] CI runs all test types

## What's NOT Included (By Design)

**Avoided Gold-Plating**:
- ❌ Complex multi-environment CI pipelines (single workflow is enough)
- ❌ Full RLS role matrices (stub only, expanded in Phase 2)
- ❌ Rich audit triggers (empty scaffold, wired in Phase 2)
- ❌ MTL business logic (compliance stubs only)
- ❌ Additional table policies beyond player (Phase 2 domain services)

**Why**: Phase 0 is a **safety net**, not a fortress. We don't protect things that don't exist yet. Security hardens as features are built.

---

## Next Steps (User Action Required)

### Immediate (Before Phase 2)
1. **Execute Security Migrations**:
   - Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vaicxfihdldgepzryhpd/sql
   - Run migrations in order: `20251002010000` → `20251002020000` → `20251002030000` → `20251002040000`
   - Copy/paste SQL from [supabase/migrations/](../../supabase/migrations/) files

2. **Verify Migrations**:
   - Run verification queries from [migrations/README.md](../../supabase/migrations/README.md)
   - Check RLS enabled, policies exist, enums created

3. **Regenerate Types**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:types
   ```

4. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Phase 0: CI/CD, testing infrastructure, security skeleton"
   git push
   ```

5. **Verify CI Passes**:
   - Check GitHub Actions workflow succeeds
   - Review coverage report (optional: set up Codecov)

### Phase 2 Preparation
- Delete [__tests__/example.test.ts](../../__tests__/example.test.ts)
- Write first TDD vertical slice: Player → Visit → Rating Slip
- Follow service testing matrix from [TESTING_SETUP.md](TESTING_SETUP.md)

## Team Notes

**Philosophy**: Phase 0 is **intentionally minimal**. It provides:
1. Fast feedback (CI, pre-commit hooks)
2. Quality gates (lint, type-check, test)
3. Security baseline (RLS enabled, audit scaffolding)
4. Anti-pattern prevention (ESLint enforcement)

**Not a fortress**: Complex security policies, rich audit logic, and full test coverage come **incrementally** as features are built in Phase 2+.

**Defer complexity**: We avoid premature optimization. Every line of code has a clear purpose aligned with PRD requirements.

**Phase 0 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (pending migration execution by user)

Proceed to Phase 2: TDD Vertical Slice (Player → Visit → Rating Slip)
