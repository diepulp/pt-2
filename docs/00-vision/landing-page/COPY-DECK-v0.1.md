## Problems We Remove (Section 3)

**Section headline:** What changes on day one.

1. **No more blank states**
   Start Gateway routes every user to the correct next step — bootstrap, setup, or the app.

2. **Fast player context**
   Win/loss, buy-ins, visits, rewards — visible without hunting through binders or spreadsheets.

3. **Shift continuity**
   Standardized logs and consistent handover signals between shifts.

4. **Audit posture**
   Append-only events where it matters. Changes leave a trail.

5. **One tenant truth**
   Staff binding and casino settings drive access and readiness. No shared logins.

## How It Works (Section 5 — Start Gateway)

**Section headline:** One guided path to operational.

**Timeline steps:**

1. **Sign in**
   Secure authentication via email and password.

2. **Bootstrap**
   If you're new, create your casino workspace and bind your staff account.

3. **Initial setup**
   Configure basics — tables, areas, game defaults, staff roles. When ready, the app opens.

**Footnote:**
> Player Tracker never guesses where you belong — it checks the database and routes you correctly.

**Optional micro-diagram:**
`/ → /start → (/signin | /app/bootstrap | /app/setup | /app)`

## FAQ (Section 8 — 7 Questions)

**Section headline:** Common questions.

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | **What is Player Tracker for?** | Player Tracker is a shift-ready CRM for table games operations. It tracks player sessions, rewards, visits, and floor activity for card rooms. |
| 2 | **Who is it for?** | Pit bosses, shift managers, operations leads, and casino administrators who need consistent, auditable player tracking. |
| 3 | **What happens after I sign in?** | Start Gateway checks your account status and routes you to the right step — bootstrap (new tenant), setup (incomplete config), or straight into the app. |
| 4 | **Do I need to set up tables first?** | Yes. After creating your casino workspace, the Setup Wizard guides you through configuring areas, tables, and game defaults before the app is fully operational. |
| 5 | **Can one user manage multiple casinos?** | Not in the current version. Each staff account is bound to one casino. Multi-casino support is a future consideration. |
| 6 | **Do you have billing?** | Not yet. We're in pilot/early access. Contact us to discuss access and pricing. |
| 7 | **How is data secured?** | All app routes are auth-protected. Data is isolated per casino via staff binding and row-level security policies. /home/diepulp/Downloads/COPY-DECK-v0.2.md |
