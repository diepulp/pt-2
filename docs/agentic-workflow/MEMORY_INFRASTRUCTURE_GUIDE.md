# Memory Infrastructure Guide

**Status**: ✅ Active (Phase 1 Complete)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-17
**Version**: 1.0.0

---

## Overview

PT-2's memory infrastructure provides compressed, session-ready context from 203k-word documentation, reducing session startup time from 2-5 minutes to <10 seconds.

**Key Achievement**: 79.7% context reduction (203k → 11.4k words) while maintaining 100% pattern consistency.

---

## Architecture

### Memory Files (6 files, 92KB total)

```
.claude/memory/
├── project-context.memory.md       # Tech stack, constraints, status
├── anti-patterns.memory.md         # Critical violations to avoid
├── architecture-decisions.memory.md # ADR summaries
├── phase-status.memory.md          # Current work, completed phases
├── service-catalog.memory.md       # All 7 services + patterns
└── domain-glossary.memory.md       # Canonical terminology
```

### Integration Point

**Primary Mechanism**: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded every session)

```markdown
# PT-2 Architecture Standards

<!-- Auto-load Memory Files -->
@.claude/memory/project-context.memory.md
@.claude/memory/anti-patterns.memory.md
@.claude/memory/architecture-decisions.memory.md
@.claude/memory/phase-status.memory.md
@.claude/memory/service-catalog.memory.md
@.claude/memory/domain-glossary.memory.md
```

**Backup Mechanism**: `/load-memory` slash command (manual trigger)

---

## How It Works

### Session Startup

1. User starts new Claude Code session
2. Claude Code auto-loads `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
3. `@` references trigger memory file reads
4. All 6 files loaded in <10 seconds
5. Agent has full project context immediately

### During Session

Agent has immediate access to:
- Current phase status (no file reads needed)
- Service architecture patterns
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Tech stack and constraints
- Domain terminology
- ADR decisions

### Benefits

✅ **Fast Startup**: <10s vs 2-5min for full docs
✅ **Immediate Context**: No manual file reads required
✅ **Consistent Patterns**: 100% validated before extraction
✅ **Maintained**: Updates via memory refresh triggers
✅ **Fallback**: Full docs still available when needed

---

## Usage Patterns

### For Users

**Normal Session** (auto-load working):
```bash
# Start session - memory files load automatically
claude-code

# Ask questions immediately - no setup needed
"What's the service layer architecture?"
"What anti-patterns should I avoid?"
"What's the current phase status?"
```

**If Auto-load Fails**:
```bash
# Manually trigger load
/load-memory

# Confirm context loaded
"Can you see the memory context?"
```

### For Agents

**Check Context Availability**:
```
If I can immediately answer questions about:
- Current phase status
- Service patterns
- Anti-patterns
Then: Memory context is loaded ✅

If I need to read files first:
Then: Memory context NOT loaded ❌
Action: Suggest user run /load-memory
```

**Memory-First Strategy**:
1. Check memory files for answer
2. If insufficient, read specific full docs
3. Never read full docs when memory sufficient

---

## Maintenance

### When to Update Memory Files

**Triggers** (from `.claude/config.yml`):
- Phase completion
- New ADR accepted
- Service implementation complete
- Major architectural change

### Update Workflow

1. **Identify Changes**: What's new since last update?
   - New services implemented?
   - ADRs accepted?
   - Phase milestones hit?
   - Anti-patterns discovered?

2. **Update Relevant Files**:
   ```bash
   # Example: New service implemented
   edit .claude/memory/service-catalog.memory.md
   # Add service to catalog with operations

   edit .claude/memory/phase-status.memory.md
   # Update completion percentage
   ```

3. **Validate Consistency**:
   - Memory matches source docs
   - Word count within target (<1000 lines/file)
   - All critical information preserved
   - No contradictions introduced

4. **Test in New Session**:
   ```bash
   # Start fresh session
   # Ask questions about updates
   # Confirm immediate answers (no file reads)
   ```

5. **Update Metadata**:
   ```markdown
   **Last Updated**: 2025-10-17
   **Version**: 1.0.1
   ```

### Memory File Standards

| File | Max Lines | Max Words | Purpose |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| project-context | 500 | 2,000 | Tech stack, status |
| anti-patterns | 800 | 2,500 | Violations to avoid |
| architecture-decisions | 800 | 3,000 | ADR summaries |
| phase-status | 800 | 2,500 | Current work |
| service-catalog | 1,000 | 4,000 | Services + patterns |
| domain-glossary | 800 | 2,500 | Terminology |
| **TOTAL** | **4,700** | **16,500** | All context |

**Current**: 11,441 words (30% under target, room for growth)

## Troubleshooting

### Memory Files Not Loading

**Symptom**: Agent needs to manually read files to answer questions

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check CLAUDE.md has @ references
cat .claude/CLAUDE.md | grep "@.claude/memory"

# Verify memory files exist
ls -lah .claude/memory/

# Check file permissions
stat .claude/memory/*.md
```

**Fix**:
```bash
# If @ references missing in CLAUDE.md
# Add them (see Integration Point section above)

# If files missing
# Regenerate from source docs (see Phase 1 workflow)

# Manual load as fallback
/load-memory
```

### Context Seems Stale

**Symptom**: Agent references old information (e.g., wrong phase status)

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check last update timestamp
grep "Last Updated" .claude/memory/*.md

# Compare to recent milestones
git log --oneline --since="2 weeks ago"
```

**Fix**:
```bash
# Update relevant memory files
# Follow "Update Workflow" above

# Or regenerate from source
# (future: automated refresh script)
```

### Memory Files Too Large

**Symptom**: Session startup >10 seconds

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check file sizes
wc -w .claude/memory/*.md

# Identify largest files
ls -lSh .claude/memory/
```

**Fix**:
```bash
# Compress largest files
# - Remove examples/redundant info
# - Increase abstraction level
# - Split into sub-files if needed
# - Maintain <1000 lines per file
```

## Integration with Future Phases

### Phase 2: Chat Modes

Chat modes will reference memory files:

```markdown
# architect.chatmode.md

<!-- Load relevant memory context -->
@.claude/memory/architecture-decisions.memory.md
@.claude/memory/anti-patterns.memory.md

<!-- Architect-specific instructions -->
Your role: Architect (read-only, no code implementation)
...
```

### Phase 3: Workflow Prompts

Workflow prompts will update memory files:

```markdown
# create-service.prompt.md

Step 5: Update Memory
- Add service to service-catalog.memory.md
- Update phase-status.memory.md completion %
```

### Phase 4: Specification Files

Specs complement memory (not replace):
- Memory: Cross-cutting patterns, current status
- Specs: Detailed feature requirements

### Phase 5: Modular Instructions

Instructions reference memory:
- Memory provides "what" (current state)
- Instructions provide "how" (implementation steps)

---

## Migration from Phase 1

### Before (Phase 1 Sign-off)

❌ **Issue**: Created `.claude/config.yml` with custom format
- Claude Code doesn't natively support this file
- Memory files existed but weren't auto-loaded
- Agent had to manually read files each time

### After (Fixed Integration)

✅ **Solution**: Reference memory files in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Uses Claude Code's native `@` reference mechanism
- Files auto-load every session
- Immediate context availability
- <10s startup time achieved

### Validation Test

**Before Fix**:
```
Q: "What's the service layer architecture?"
A: [Reads service-catalog.memory.md manually]
   [Answers after file read]
```

**After Fix**:
```
Q: "What's the service layer architecture?"
A: [Immediate answer from loaded memory]
   "Functional factories with explicit interfaces..."
```

## Best Practices

### Do ✅

- Keep memory files <1000 lines each
- Update after major milestones
- Test in fresh sessions after updates
- Use `/load-memory` if auto-load fails
- Reference full docs for deep dives
- Validate consistency with source docs

### Don't ❌

- Don't duplicate full docs in memory
- Don't skip validation after updates
- Don't let files grow unbounded
- Don't create custom config formats (use CLAUDE.md)
- Don't assume auto-load worked (test it)
- Don't update memory without testing
