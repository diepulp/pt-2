# Phase C Fix Summary: SQL Function Corrections

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Phases**: C.0 and C.1 Complete

---

## Issue Summary

During Phase C implementation, encountered two SQL type mismatch errors in the `check_phase_c1_cutover_gate()` validation function that blocked migration completion.

---

## Issues Encountered

### Issue #1: Ambiguous Column Reference

**Error**:
```
ERROR: column reference "can_proceed" is ambiguous (SQLSTATE 42702)
It could refer to either a PL/pgSQL variable or a table column.
```

**Root Cause**:
Unqualified column references in UNION query couldn't disambiguate between function return columns and CTE columns.

**Fix Applied**:
```sql
-- BEFORE (ambiguous)
SELECT * FROM gate_results
UNION ALL
SELECT 'OVERALL_DECISION'::text, ..., can_proceed
FROM gate_results;

-- AFTER (qualified)
SELECT gr.gate_name, gr.status, gr.failing_count, gr.can_proceed
FROM gate_results gr
UNION ALL
SELECT 'OVERALL_DECISION'::text AS gate_name, ..., gr.can_proceed
FROM gate_results gr;
```

**Lines Changed**: `supabase/migrations/20251020120000_phase_c0_validation_infrastructure.sql:163-174`

---

### Issue #2: Type Mismatch (numeric vs bigint)

**Error**:
```
ERROR: structure of query does not match function result type
DETAIL: Returned type numeric does not match expected type bigint in column 3.
```

**Root Cause**:
`SUM()` aggregate returns `numeric` type, but function signature declared `bigint` for `failing_count` column.

**Fix Applied**:
```sql
-- BEFORE
SUM(gr.failing_count) AS failing_count

-- AFTER
SUM(gr.failing_count)::bigint AS failing_count
```

**Line Changed**: `supabase/migrations/20251020120000_phase_c0_validation_infrastructure.sql:172`

---

## Verification Results

### Cutover Gate Function Test

```sql
SELECT * FROM check_phase_c1_cutover_gate();
```

**Output**:
```
       gate_name       | status | failing_count | can_proceed
-----------------------+--------+---------------+-------------
 divergence_check      | PASS   |             0 | t
 backfill_completeness | PASS   |             0 | t
 orphaned_references   | PASS   |             0 | t
 alert_history         | PASS   |             0 | t
 OVERALL_DECISION      | GO     |             0 | t
```

✅ **All gates passing** - Ready for Phase C.2.1

### Migration Success

**Phase C.0**: ✅ Applied successfully
```
NOTICE: Phase C.0 validation infrastructure installed successfully
```

**Phase C.1**: ✅ Applied successfully
```
NOTICE: Pre-migration validation passed: 0 orphaned records
NOTICE: Backfill validation passed: total_rows=0, non_null_patron_id=0, backfilled=0
NOTICE: Phase C.1 verification passed: FK constraint, parity constraint, and 2 indexes created
```

---

### Schema Verification

**Columns**:
```
 column_name | data_type | is_nullable
-------------+-----------+-------------
 patron_id   | text      | YES         (will become generated)
 patron_uuid | uuid      | YES         (authoritative)
```

**Constraints**:
```
fk_mtl_entry_patron: FOREIGN KEY (patron_uuid) REFERENCES player(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
mtl_patron_uuid_parity_chk: CHECK patron_id::uuid = patron_uuid during transition
```

**Indexes**:
```
idx_mtl_entry_patron_uuid         - Patron lookups
idx_mtl_entry_patron_created      - Transaction history (patron_uuid, created_at DESC)
```

---

## TypeScript Types

**Regenerated**: ✅ `npm run db:types` completed successfully

**New Type Definition** (`types/remote/database.types.ts`):
```typescript
mtl_entry: {
  Row: {
    // ...
    patron_id: string | null        // TEXT (will become generated)
    patron_uuid: string | null      // UUID (authoritative)
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Lessons Learned

### SQL Function Development

1. **Always qualify column references** in CTEs with UNION queries
2. **Match aggregate return types** to function signatures (cast when needed)
3. **Test functions immediately** after creation, not during migration execution
4. **Use explicit column lists** in SELECT to avoid ambiguity

### Migration Testing

1. **Isolate validation queries** from migration execution
2. **Comment out test queries** that call complex functions during migration
3. **Run validation manually** after migration completes
4. **Use incremental testing** for complex functions
