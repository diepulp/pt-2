## Current State

### ✅ Completed (Day 2 - RatingSlip Service)

**RatingSlip Service Full CRUD - SIMPLIFIED (KISS + YAGNI Applied) ✅**
- [services/ratingslip/crud.ts](~/services/ratingslip/crud.ts) - Simplified CRUD: create(), update(), getById()
  - `create()`: UUID generation + 23503 → FOREIGN_KEY_VIOLATION (playerId, visit_id, gaming_table_id)
  - `getById()`: PGRST116 → NOT_FOUND
  - `update()`: PGRST116 → NOT_FOUND, supports averageBet, status, endTime, seatNumber
  - **Simplification**: Removed inventory fields (cashIn, chipsBrought, chipsTaken, gameSettingsId)
  - **Type Safety**: Fixed gameSettings type error (Record<string, unknown> → exact Json type)
  - **Code Quality**: Explicit object building instead of 6 spread operators
- [services/ratingslip/index.ts](~/services/ratingslip/index.ts) - Explicit RatingSlipService interface
- [__tests__/services/ratingslip/ratingslip-service.test.ts](~/__tests__/services/ratingslip/ratingslip-service.test.ts) - 10/10 tests passing
  - Create: happy path (required + optional fields) + foreign key violations (player, visit)
  - GetById: happy path + not found
  - Update: status/averageBet/endTime/seatNumber + not found
  - Removed inventory-focused tests (aligned with simplified DTO)
- [docs/phase-2/ratingslip-simplification-analysis.md](~/docs/phase-2/ratingslip-simplification-analysis.md) - Full KISS/YAGNI analysis
- **Velocity**: ~40 minutes from scaffold to all tests passing
- **Complexity Reduction**: 30% (10 fields → 7 fields)
- **Complex features**: JSON fields (game_settings), computed fields (points), multiple FKs

### ✅ Completed (Day 2 - Visit Service)

**Visit Service Full CRUD - Template Velocity Test**
- [services/visit/crud.ts](~/services/visit/crud.ts) - Complete CRUD: create(), update(), getById()
  - `create()`: 23503 → FOREIGN_KEY_VIOLATION (player_id, casino_id)
  - `getById()`: PGRST116 → NOT_FOUND
  - `update()`: PGRST116 → NOT_FOUND, supports checkOutDate, mode, status
- [services/visit/index.ts](~/services/visit/index.ts) - Explicit VisitService interface
- [__tests__/services/visit/visit-service.test.ts](~/__tests__/services/visit/visit-service.test.ts) - 10/10 tests passing
  - Create: happy path (required + optional fields) + foreign key violations
  - GetById: happy path + not found
  - Update: status/checkOutDate/mode + not found
- **Velocity**: ~45 minutes from scaffold to all tests passing (vs Player: ~3 hours)
- **Template effectiveness**: 4x faster with locked pattern

### ✅ Completed (Day 1-2)

**Slice 2 - TDD `update()` + `getById()` Operations (Just Completed)**
- [services/player/crud.ts](~/services/player/crud.ts) - Added `update()` and `getById()` with error mapping
  - `getById()`: PGRST116 → NOT_FOUND
  - `update()`: PGRST116 → NOT_FOUND, 23505 → DUPLICATE_EMAIL
- [services/player/index.ts](~/services/player/index.ts) - Updated PlayerService interface with new methods
- [__tests__/services/player/player-service.test.ts](~/__tests__/services/player/player-service.test.ts) - 8/8 tests passing
  - Create: happy path + duplicate email
  - GetById: happy path + not found
  - Update: happy path (names + email) + not found + duplicate email
- All error mappings working correctly
- Zero violations of PRD standards

### ✅ Completed (Day 1)

**1. Player Service Slice 1 - TDD `create()` Operation**
- [services/shared/types.ts](~/services/shared/types.ts) - ServiceResult, ServiceError interfaces
- [services/shared/utils.ts](~/services/shared/utils.ts) - generateRequestId helper
- [services/shared/operation-wrapper.ts](~/services/shared/operation-wrapper.ts) - executeOperation with structured error handling
- [services/player/crud.ts](~/services/player/crud.ts) - create() with duplicate email detection (23505 → DUPLICATE_EMAIL)
- [services/player/index.ts](~/services/player/index.ts) - Explicit PlayerService interface + typed factory
- [__tests__/services/player/player-service.test.ts](~/__tests__/services/player/player-service.test.ts) - Happy path + duplicate error tests
- [app/actions/player/create-player-action.ts](~/app/actions/player/create-player-action.ts) - Server action
- [components/player/player-form.tsx](~/components/player/player-form.tsx) - UI form with success/error messaging
- [app/players/page.tsx](~/app/players/page.tsx) - Demo page

**2. Canonical Documentation (Template Lock)**
- [docs/patterns/SERVICE_TEMPLATE.md](~/docs/patterns/SERVICE_TEMPLATE.md) - 500+ line comprehensive reference (Layer 1: Living Canon)
- [docs/patterns/SERVICE_TEMPLATE_QUICK.md](~/docs/patterns/SERVICE_TEMPLATE_QUICK.md) - 2-page developer cheat sheet (Layer 2: Operational)
- [docs/patterns/controlled-hybrid-refactor-model.md](~/docs/patterns/controlled-hybrid-refactor-model.md) - Strategic model with guardrails

**3. PT-1 Architecture Audit Completed**
- Audit: 85/100 compliance score
- Decision: Controlled Hybrid approach (TDD slices + strategic PT-1 mining)
- Violations identified: `@/types/database-rebuilt`, `services/x/types.ts`, `@deprecated` code
- Mining strategy: Time-box ≤4h, One-Violation Rule (rewrite if ANY violation)

### 🔄 Current Agenda (Day 3)

**Status**: RatingSlip simplification complete ✅ + Bounded context integrity established ✅

---

#### **Immediate Priority: Domain Separation Implementation**

**Context**: RatingSlip KISS/YAGNI audit revealed domain coupling violation
- RatingSlip was mixing **performance metrics** (average bet, points) with **financial tracking** (cash in/out, chips)
- Simplification applied: removed financial fields from RatingSlip
- **Next**: Create PlayerFinancialService to own financial domain

**Service Responsibility Matrix Created** ✅
- [docs/phase-2/SERVICE_RESPONSIBILITY_MATRIX.md](~/docs/phase-2/SERVICE_RESPONSIBILITY_MATRIX.md)
- Defines bounded contexts: Identity, Location, Session, Performance, Finance
- Data flow patterns: RatingSlip ↔ Player ↔ Casino ↔ PlayerFinancial
- Anti-patterns documented (cross-domain ownership, service-to-service calls)

---

#### **Next Implementation: PlayerFinancialService**

**Purpose**: Own financial transactions separate from performance tracking

**Scope**:
1. Create `services/player-financial/` module following template
2. Schema: `player_financial_transaction` table
   - Fields: cash_in, chips_brought, chips_taken, transaction_type, reconciliation_status
   - References: player_id, visit_id, rating_slip_id (optional)
3. CRUD operations: create(), getById(), getByVisitId(), getByPlayerId()
4. Test coverage >80%

**Bounded Context**: "What money/chips moved in/out?" (NOT "how well did player perform?")

**Estimated Time**: 45-60 minutes (template proven at 40-45min avg)

---

#### **After PlayerFinancialService: Integration Layer**

**Aggregate Query Pattern** (client/action layer orchestration):
```typescript
// Example: Get complete session summary
async function getSessionSummary(visitId: string) {
  const [visit, ratingSlips, financials] = await Promise.all([
    visitService.getById(visitId),
    ratingSlipService.getByVisitId(visitId),
    playerFinancialService.getByVisitId(visitId),
  ]);

  return {
    performance: aggregate(ratingSlips),  // Points, time, avg bet
    financials: aggregate(financials),     // Cash flow, net change
  };
}
```

---

#### **PT-1 Mining: Deferred Until Core Services Complete**

Two expert agents have analyzed PT-1 code in parallel:

**Agent 1: search.ts Analysis**
- Status: Full rewrite required (~8h)
- Violations: 2 critical (`ReturnType`, `any[]`)
- Business Value: HIGH (multi-word search + relevance scoring)

**Agent 2: queries.ts Analysis**
- Status: Adapt with confidence (~8.75h)
- Violations: 1 minor (`ReturnType` export only)
- Compliance: 90/100 (exceeds PT-2 threshold)

**Decision**: Defer PT-1 mining until PlayerFinancialService complete
- Reason: Bounded context integrity > advanced features
- Core CRUD layer must be solid before adding search/query complexity

### 📅 Week 1 Roadmap (Updated)

- **Day 1** ✅: Player create() + documentation locked (3h)
- **Day 2** ✅: Player update()+getById() + Visit full CRUD (4h total, Visit: 45min)
- **Day 3** ✅: RatingSlip Service + KISS/YAGNI simplification + Bounded context design (3h)
- **Day 4** 🔄: PlayerFinancialService implementation (1h) + Integration patterns (1-2h)
- **Day 5** (2-4h): Aggregate queries + PT-1 mining (search/queries) OR remaining CRUD services

**Velocity Metrics (Rule of Three Complete):**
- Player Service (first implementation): ~3 hours for full CRUD
- Visit Service (template application): ~45 minutes for full CRUD
- RatingSlip Service (template + complexity): ~40 minutes for full CRUD
- **5x average improvement** with locked template (Player: 180min → Template: 42.5min avg)

**Pattern Validation:**
- ✅ Simple domain (Player): Template works
- ✅ Relational domain (Visit): Template scales
- ✅ Complex domain (RatingSlip): Template handles JSON, computed fields, multiple FKs
- **Conclusion**: Template proven across all complexity levels

### 🎯 Success Criteria

- ✅ Zero PRD violations (One-Violation Rule enforced)
- ✅ All operations return `ServiceResult<T>`
- ✅ Explicit interfaces (no `ReturnType`)
- ✅ Typed `supabase: SupabaseClient<Database>`
- ✅ Error mapping: DB constraints → business errors
- ✅ Test coverage >80%

### 🔗 Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Controlled Hybrid Model**: TDD slices + strategic PT-1 mining (not full migration)
2. **Template-First**: Lock pattern early for Visit/RatingSlip acceleration
3. **Two-Layer Docs**: Comprehensive canon + operational quick reference
4. **Rule of Three**: Don't generalize until 3rd occurrence
5. **Time-Box Mining**: ≤4h per PT-1 module exploration

### 💡 Quick Start Next Session

**Recommended: PlayerFinancialService Implementation**

```bash
# Verify all existing services still passing
npm test __tests__/services/player/player-service.test.ts
npm test __tests__/services/visit/visit-service.test.ts
npm test __tests__/services/ratingslip/ratingslip-service.test.ts

# Review bounded context model
cat docs/phase-2/SERVICE_RESPONSIBILITY_MATRIX.md

# Create PlayerFinancialService following template
mkdir -p services/player-financial __tests__/services/player-financial

# Schema review: Check if player_financial_transaction table exists
# If not, create migration following docs/phase-2/SERVICE_RESPONSIBILITY_MATRIX.md schema

# Start with create() slice following TDD approach
# Reference: services/ratingslip/ (most recent, similar complexity)
```

**Key Constraints**:
- Financial domain only: cash_in, chips_brought, chips_taken
- No performance metrics (those belong to RatingSlip)
- References: player_id, visit_id, rating_slip_id (optional)
- Bounded context: "What money/chips moved in/out?"

### 🚨 Anti-Pattern Guardrails

Before writing ANY code:

| ❌ Never | ✅ Always |
|---------|----------|
| `ReturnType<typeof createXService>` | Explicit `interface XService` |
| `supabase: any` | `supabase: SupabaseClient<Database>` |
| `@/types/database-rebuilt` | `Database['public']['Tables']['x']` |
| `services/x/types.ts` | `types/domains/x/` |

**One-Violation Rule**: If PT-1 code breaks ANY → rewrite, don't patch.
