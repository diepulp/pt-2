> **Context Window**: 43k/200k tokens used

## Current State

### ‚úÖ Completed (Day 1-2)

**Slice 2 - TDD `update()` + `getById()` Operations (Just Completed)**
- [services/player/crud.ts](~/services/player/crud.ts) - Added `update()` and `getById()` with error mapping
  - `getById()`: PGRST116 ‚Üí NOT_FOUND
  - `update()`: PGRST116 ‚Üí NOT_FOUND, 23505 ‚Üí DUPLICATE_EMAIL
- [services/player/index.ts](~/services/player/index.ts) - Updated PlayerService interface with new methods
- [__tests__/services/player/player-service.test.ts](~/__tests__/services/player/player-service.test.ts) - 8/8 tests passing
  - Create: happy path + duplicate email
  - GetById: happy path + not found
  - Update: happy path (names + email) + not found + duplicate email
- All error mappings working correctly
- Zero violations of PRD standards

### ‚úÖ Completed (Day 1)

**1. Player Service Slice 1 - TDD `create()` Operation**
- [services/shared/types.ts](~/services/shared/types.ts) - ServiceResult, ServiceError interfaces
- [services/shared/utils.ts](~/services/shared/utils.ts) - generateRequestId helper
- [services/shared/operation-wrapper.ts](~/services/shared/operation-wrapper.ts) - executeOperation with structured error handling
- [services/player/crud.ts](~/services/player/crud.ts) - create() with duplicate email detection (23505 ‚Üí DUPLICATE_EMAIL)
- [services/player/index.ts](~/services/player/index.ts) - Explicit PlayerService interface + typed factory
- [__tests__/services/player/player-service.test.ts](~/__tests__/services/player/player-service.test.ts) - Happy path + duplicate error tests
- [app/actions/player/create-player-action.ts](~/app/actions/player/create-player-action.ts) - Server action
- [components/player/player-form.tsx](~/components/player/player-form.tsx) - UI form with success/error messaging
- [app/players/page.tsx](~/app/players/page.tsx) - Demo page

**2. Canonical Documentation (Template Lock)**
- [docs/patterns/SERVICE_TEMPLATE.md](~/docs/patterns/SERVICE_TEMPLATE.md) - 500+ line comprehensive reference (Layer 1: Living Canon)
- [docs/patterns/SERVICE_TEMPLATE_QUICK.md](~/docs/patterns/SERVICE_TEMPLATE_QUICK.md) - 2-page developer cheat sheet (Layer 2: Operational)
- [docs/patterns/controlled-hybrid-refactor-model.md](~/docs/patterns/controlled-hybrid-refactor-model.md) - Strategic model with guardrails

**3. PT-1 Architecture Audit Completed**
- Audit: 85/100 compliance score
- Decision: Controlled Hybrid approach (TDD slices + strategic PT-1 mining)
- Violations identified: `@/types/database-rebuilt`, `services/x/types.ts`, `@deprecated` code
- Mining strategy: Time-box ‚â§4h, One-Violation Rule (rewrite if ANY violation)

### üîÑ Next Steps (Day 3)

**Option A: PT-1 Mining - Search & Queries (4h time-box)**
- Mine [reference-pt-1/services/player/search.ts](~/reference-pt-1/services/player/search.ts)
- Mine [reference-pt-1/services/player/queries.ts](~/reference-pt-1/services/player/queries.ts)
- Apply One-Violation Rule: Rewrite if ANY violation found
- Integrate into player service following template

**Option B: Visit Service Slice 1 (TDD create())**
- Create [services/visit/](~/services/visit/) following player template
- Leverage existing shared infrastructure
- Test velocity improvement from locked patterns

**Recommended**: Option B - Visit Service to validate template effectiveness before PT-1 mining

### üìÖ Week 1 Roadmap

- **Day 1** ‚úÖ: `create()` + documentation locked
- **Day 2** ‚úÖ: `update()` + `getById()` (Player CRUD complete - 8/8 tests passing)
- **Day 3** üîÑ: Visit Service Slice 1 OR PT-1 mining (search.ts + queries.ts)
- **Day 4** (4h): Complete Visit CRUD OR mine remaining PT-1 modules
- **Day 5** (2h): Integration tests + end-of-week audit

### üéØ Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Zero PRD violations (One-Violation Rule enforced)
- ‚úÖ All operations return `ServiceResult<T>`
- ‚úÖ Explicit interfaces (no `ReturnType`)
- ‚úÖ Typed `supabase: SupabaseClient<Database>`
- ‚úÖ Error mapping: DB constraints ‚Üí business errors
- ‚úÖ Test coverage >80%

### üîó Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Controlled Hybrid Model**: TDD slices + strategic PT-1 mining (not full migration)
2. **Template-First**: Lock pattern early for Visit/RatingSlip acceleration
3. **Two-Layer Docs**: Comprehensive canon + operational quick reference
4. **Rule of Three**: Don't generalize until 3rd occurrence
5. **Time-Box Mining**: ‚â§4h per PT-1 module exploration

### üìÇ Critical Files Reference

**Implementation:**
- [services/player/](~/services/player/) - Current implementation
- [reference-pt-1/services/player/](~/reference-pt-1/services/player/) - PT-1 source for mining

**Documentation:**
- [docs/patterns/SERVICE_TEMPLATE_QUICK.md](~/docs/patterns/SERVICE_TEMPLATE_QUICK.md) - **Use this for implementation**
- [docs/patterns/SERVICE_TEMPLATE.md](~/docs/patterns/SERVICE_TEMPLATE.md) - Full spec
- [docs/system-prd/SERVICE_LAYER_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md](~/docs/system-prd/SERVICE_LAYER_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md) - Architecture

**PRD Compliance:**
- [docs/system-prd/CANONICAL_BLUEPRINT_MVP_PRD.md](~/docs/system-prd/CANONICAL_BLUEPRINT_MVP_PRD.md) - Anti-patterns ¬ß4

### üí° Quick Start Next Session

**Option A: Visit Service (Recommended)**
```bash
# Verify player service still passing
npm test __tests__/services/player/player-service.test.ts

# Create visit service following template
mkdir -p services/visit __tests__/services/visit
# Copy template pattern from player service
# Start with create() slice following TDD approach
```

**Option B: PT-1 Mining**
```bash
# Review PT-1 search module
cat reference-pt-1/services/player/search.ts

# Check for violations before mining
# Apply One-Violation Rule: ANY violation ‚Üí full rewrite
```

### üö® Anti-Pattern Guardrails

Before writing ANY code:

| ‚ùå Never | ‚úÖ Always |
|---------|----------|
| `ReturnType<typeof createXService>` | Explicit `interface XService` |
| `supabase: any` | `supabase: SupabaseClient<Database>` |
| `@/types/database-rebuilt` | `Database['public']['Tables']['x']` |
| `services/x/types.ts` | `types/domains/x/` |

**One-Violation Rule**: If PT-1 code breaks ANY ‚Üí rewrite, don't patch.

## Resume Prompt (Day 3)

```
Phase 2 Player Service - CRUD Complete. Choose next vertical slice:

Current state:
- Player Service Slice 1 ‚úÖ: create() with duplicate detection
- Player Service Slice 2 ‚úÖ: update() + getById() with error mapping
- All tests passing (8/8) ‚úÖ
- Template documentation locked ‚úÖ
- Shared infrastructure ready for reuse ‚úÖ

Option A (Recommended): Visit Service Slice 1
- Apply template to new domain
- Validate pattern velocity
- Leverage shared/ infrastructure
- Time: 1-2h (faster with template)

Option B: PT-1 Mining
- Mine reference-pt-1/services/player/search.ts + queries.ts
- Apply One-Violation Rule
- Time: 4h time-box

Reference:
- Template: docs/patterns/SERVICE_TEMPLATE_QUICK.md
- Player implementation: services/player/ (reference for Visit)
- Shared infrastructure: services/shared/

Decision point: Visit first (validate template) OR mine PT-1 (add complexity)?
```
