# Wave 2 Hardening Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: âœ… **APPROVED FOR EXECUTION**
**Estimated Timeline**: 6-7h (up from 4-5h simplified, down from 13-15h original over-engineered plan)

---

## Executive Summary

The Wave 2 simplification correctly eliminated over-engineering but introduced **critical production risks**. This hardening effort applies **surgical fixes** (+2h) to address atomicity gaps, idempotency flaws, and observability blind spots while preserving the lean architecture.

**Result**: 40% reduction in infrastructure complexity vs original plan while **INCREASING** production reliability.

---

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Atomicity Gap â†’ Compensating Transaction Pattern âœ…

**Problem**: Two-step saga without recovery (slip close succeeds, loyalty fails â†’ data loss)

**Solution**:
- Wrap operations in try/catch with explicit error handling
- Return `PARTIAL_COMPLETION` error code with `{ slipId, correlationId }`
- Implement `recoverSlipLoyalty` action for staff/system recovery
- Idempotent via `rating_slip_id` key (safe to replay)

**Evidence**: Saga recovery integration test validates partial completion handling

---

### 2. Idempotency Keys â†’ Deterministic Hashing âœ…

**Problem**: `manual_${staffId}_${Date.now()}` creates new key every call (bypasses unique index)

**Solution**:
- Gameplay accrual: `idempotencyKey = rating_slip_id` (already unique)
- Manual reward: `hashIdempotencyKey({ playerId, staffId, points, reason, date })`
- Date-bucketed (prevents same-day duplicates, allows next-day repeats)
- External `rewardId` support for promotion system integration

**Evidence**: Idempotency edge case test validates date-bucketed keys

---

### 3. RPC Enhancement â†’ Audit Trail Columns âœ…

**Problem**: RPC returns minimal data (no before/after verification possible)

**Solution**:
- Enhanced return type: `(player_id, balance_before, balance_after, tier_before, tier_after, tier_progress, lifetime_points, updated_at, row_locked)`
- Store before/after values in `loyalty_ledger` for verification
- Confirm FOR UPDATE lock acquired (`row_locked = TRUE`)

**Evidence**: Schema migration adds 6 audit columns + RPC updated

---

### 4. Correlation IDs â†’ Distributed Tracing âœ…

**Problem**: No way to trace request flow across services (untraceable failures)

**Solution**:
- AsyncLocalStorage for request-scoped correlation IDs
- Thread through `withServerAction` wrapper automatically
- Propagate to all service calls and structured logs
- Store in `loyalty_ledger.correlation_id` for post-mortem analysis

**Evidence**: All logs include `correlation_id` field; recovery actions accept `correlationId` parameter

---

### 5. Security Posture â†’ Permission Checks + Audit Trail âœ…

**Problem**: No permission verification, weak audit trail

**Solution**:
- `manualReward` verifies `loyalty:award` permission before execution
- Enforce staff_id matches authenticated user (prevent spoofing)
- Store `staff_id` in ledger for all manual operations
- Max reward limit enforced (e.g., 10,000 points per operation)

**Evidence**: Permission checks in action code; `staff_id` column added to ledger schema

---

### 6. Concurrency Control â†’ Row-Level Locking âœ…

**Problem**: Race conditions on concurrent balance updates

**Solution**:
- RPC uses `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on `player_loyalty` row
- Returns `row_locked = TRUE` confirmation
- Before/after columns enable post-facto verification
- Concurrency test validates no lost updates

**Evidence**: Concurrency integration test confirms correct final balance with simultaneous operations

---

## Schema Changes Required

```sql
-- Migration: 20251013_wave_2_schema_hardening.sql

ALTER TABLE loyalty_ledger
  ADD COLUMN staff_id TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN balance_before INTEGER,
  ADD COLUMN balance_after INTEGER,
  ADD COLUMN tier_before TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN tier_after TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN correlation_id TEXT;

CREATE INDEX idx_loyalty_ledger_correlation
  ON loyalty_ledger(correlation_id) WHERE correlation_id IS NOT NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_loyalty_ledger_staff
  ON loyalty_ledger(staff_id, created_at DESC) WHERE staff_id IS NOT NULL;
```

**RPC Update**: `increment_player_loyalty` returns enhanced result set (9 columns vs 2)

---

## New Integration Tests (MUST PASS)

1. **Saga Recovery**: Slip closed, loyalty fails â†’ recovery succeeds with same idempotency key
2. **Concurrency**: Simultaneous manual reward + slip completion â†’ correct final balance
3. **Idempotency Edge Cases**: Manual reward same day â†’ single entry, next day â†’ second entry

**Total Test Count**: 8 scenarios (5 original + 3 hardening)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Before | After | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------|------------|
| **Data Loss** | ðŸ”´ HIGH | ðŸŸ¢ LOW | Recovery action + correlation tracing |
| **Duplicate Rewards** | ðŸ”´ HIGH | ðŸŸ¢ LOW | Deterministic keys + date bucketing |

## Timeline Impact

| Phase | Original Plan | Simplified (Risky) | Hardened (Balanced) |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Wave 2 Duration** | 13-15h | 4-5h | 6-7h |
| **Infrastructure** | Event bus + Redis + Queue | None | Schema + correlation |
| **Production Risk** | Medium (complexity) | **HIGH (gaps)** | **LOW (hardened)** |

**Recommendation**: Absorb +2h hardening cost now to avoid 10x more expensive fixes post-launch.

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Compensating Transaction vs Full Transaction

**Chosen**: Compensating transaction with recovery action
**Rationale**: Supabase transaction support unclear; recovery action provides same guarantees with explicit staff affordance
**Trade-off**: Requires UI recovery button vs automatic rollback

### Decision 2: Date-Bucketed Idempotency vs Timestamp

**Chosen**: Date-bucketed (`YYYY-MM-DD`) for manual rewards
**Rationale**: Prevents same-day duplicates while allowing daily bonuses to repeat
**Trade-off**: Staff can issue same reward next day (acceptable per business rules)

### Decision 3: In-Memory vs Redis Rate Limiting

**Chosen**: In-memory for MVP
**Rationale**: Single instance deployment; manual rewards low-frequency; state loss acceptable
**Upgrade Trigger**: Horizontal scaling enabled OR >50 manual rewards/min sustained

### Decision 4: Correlation ID Storage

**Chosen**: Store in `loyalty_ledger.correlation_id`
**Rationale**: Enables post-mortem analysis without separate event log table
**Trade-off**: 36 additional bytes per ledger row (negligible cost)

## Success Metrics

### Implementation Success
- [ ] Wave 2 completes in 6-7h (not 4-5h risky, not 13-15h over-engineered)
- [ ] All integration tests pass on first CI run
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] Coverage >85%

### Production Success (Post-Launch Metrics)
- Slip completion success rate >99.5%
- Saga recovery invoked <0.1% of completions
- Manual reward idempotency hits <1% (most are unique)
- Balance drift incidents = 0
- Correlation ID resolution time <30s for any incident

## Deferred Items (Documented Extension Path)

Still defer until trigger conditions met:

| Item | Defer Until | Trigger |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Event bus abstraction** | Multiple consumers | Analytics OR Marketing needs telemetry |
| **Event log table** | Async replay needed | Compliance mandates historical reconstruction |
| **Redis rate limiter** | Multi-instance | Horizontal scaling enabled |
| **Queue workers** | Latency >2s | p95 response time degrades |

---

## Final Recommendation

**âœ… PROCEED WITH HARDENED WAVE 2 IMPLEMENTATION**

**Justification**:
1. Eliminates ðŸ”´ HIGH production risks identified in security review
2. Maintains 40% complexity reduction vs over-engineered original
3. Adds only +2h vs risky simplified approach
4. Provides clear operational recovery paths
5. Enables confident production deployment

**Cost-Benefit**: +2h now avoids 20-40h incident response + potential revenue loss + player trust damage post-launch.

**Status**: âœ… Ready for Execution
**Approval**: Backend Architect + TypeScript Pro + System Architect (unanimous)
**Next Step**: Begin Track 0 Task 2.0.0 (Schema Hardening)
