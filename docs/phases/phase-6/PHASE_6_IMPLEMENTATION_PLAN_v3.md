# Phase 6 Implementation Plan (Loyalty + RatingSlip + MTL)

> **Date**: 2025-10-13
> **Scope**: Deliver RatingSlip Phase 6 with Loyalty service prerequisite and mid-session rewards
> **References**: [codex/LOYALTY_SERVICE_HANDOFF.md](./codex/LOYALTY_SERVICE_HANDOFF.md), [codex/LOYALTY_MID_SESSION_REWARD.md](./codex/LOYALTY_MID_SESSION_REWARD.md), [codex/RATINGSLIP_SCHEMA_AUDIT.md](./codex/RATINGSLIP_SCHEMA_AUDIT.md)

---

## 1. Objectives
- Preserve canonical bounded-context separation: RatingSlip gathers telemetry, Loyalty evaluates reward value.
- Enable both end-of-session accrual and mid-session adjustments (`manualReward`, `POINTS_UPDATE_REQUESTED`).
- Replace legacy schema artifacts that couple domains.
- Provide a clear wave-based execution model with quality gates and ownership.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles (from Canonical Docs)
- **Single Authoritative Mutator**: LoyaltyService is the only layer that changes point balances or writes to `loyalty_ledger`.
- **Event-Triggered Policy**: Domains emit telemetry events (`RATINGS_SLIP_COMPLETED`, `POINTS_UPDATE_REQUESTED`); Loyalty executes policy.
- **Idempotency First**: Use composite keys and soft-success semantics so duplicate rewards do not produce additional points.
- **Auditability**: Every reward delta is captured with `session_id`, `transaction_type`, `event_type`, `reason`, `source`.
- **Testable Modules**: RatingSlip closure and loyalty accrual must be testable in isolation.

---

## 3. Wave 0 – Mandatory Schema Corrections (Prerequisite)
Owner: Database/Platform (2.5h)

1. Apply `phase_6_wave_0_bounded_context_corrections.sql`:
   - Drop `ratingslip.points` column.
   - Drop `accrual_history` table.
   - Rebuild `close_player_session()` without loyalty parameters or updates.
   - Create enhanced `loyalty_ledger`:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE loyalty_ledger (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
       player_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES player(id),
       rating_slip_id UUID REFERENCES ratingslip(id),
       visit_id UUID REFERENCES visit(id),
       session_id UUID,
       transaction_type TEXT NOT NULL,           -- 'GAMEPLAY', 'MANUAL_BONUS', 'PROMOTION', 'ADJUSTMENT'
       event_type TEXT,                          -- 'RATINGS_SLIP_COMPLETED', 'POINTS_UPDATE_REQUESTED', etc.
       points_change INTEGER NOT NULL,
       reason TEXT,
       source TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'system',    -- 'system', 'manual', 'promotion'
       created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
     );
     ```
   - Add idempotency index *(aligning both docs)*: `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_loyalty_ledger_session_type_source ON loyalty_ledger (session_id, transaction_type, source) WHERE session_id IS NOT NULL;`
2. Update `player_loyalty` to canonical shape:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE player_loyalty (
     player_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES player(id),
     current_balance INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
     lifetime_points INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
     tier TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'BRONZE',
     tier_progress INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
     updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
     CONSTRAINT chk_tier_progress_percent CHECK (tier_progress BETWEEN 0 AND 100)
   );
   ```
3. Seed `loyalty_tier` table and ensure it is referenced by RPC.
4. Grant permissions for LoyaltyService (supabase roles) to `loyalty_ledger`, `player_loyalty`, `loyalty_tier`.
5. Backfill: migrate historical points from legacy tables into the new ledger using signed deltas (single script).

**Exit Criteria**
- Legacy columns/tables removed.
- New ledger schema and indexes present.
- `close_player_session()` no longer references points.
- Backfill verified via spot checks.

## 4. Track Overview & Timeline (18–21h parallelized)

| Track | Focus | Prereq | Waves |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| **T0** | Loyalty horizontal | Wave 0 complete | Waves 1–2 |
| **T1** | RatingSlip integration | After T0.Wave1 API ready | Waves 2–3 |
| **T2** | MTL vertical | After Wave 0 (independent) | Waves 1–3 |

---

## 5. Wave Breakdown

### Wave 1 – Loyalty Service Foundation (T0) — 8h
Deliverables:
- `services/loyalty/index.ts` interface per handoff, with `calculateAndAssignPoints`, `manualReward`, query methods.
- `business.ts`: reuse PT-1 logic, add tier multiplier support.
- `crud.ts`: helpers for inserting ledger rows (using signed deltas) and updating balances.
- `rpc` migration: `increment_player_loyalty(player_id UUID, delta_points INTEGER)` returning `(current_balance, tier)` and locking the `player_loyalty` row (`FOR UPDATE`) to prevent concurrent balance races.
- `manualReward` implementation:
  - Writes ledger row with `transaction_type = 'MANUAL_BONUS'` or `'PROMOTION'`.
  - Uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` against the composite index; on conflict returns existing balance (idempotent soft success).
  - Calls RPC and returns `(newBalance, tier)`.
- Unit tests covering calculation parity and idempotent manual reward.

Quality Gates:
- >80% coverage for `services/loyalty/business.ts` and `manualReward` path.
- Duplicate manual reward results in `success: true` with unchanged balance.
- RPC verified to update `current_balance`, `lifetime_points`, and `tier`.

### Wave 2 – Direct Service Integration (T0 + T1) — 7h ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-13)

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Architecture**: Direct Service Invocation Pattern (ADR-001)
**Report**: [WAVE_2_COMPLETION_SIGNOFF.md](./wave-2/WAVE_2_COMPLETION_SIGNOFF.md)

**Architecture Change (ADR-001)**: Wave 2 implemented **direct service invocation** instead of the originally planned event bus. This simplified pattern reduced complexity by 40% while increasing production reliability through systematic hardening (atomicity, idempotency, traceability, recovery). Extension path to event bus documented for when 2nd consumer needed (2h effort).

**Actual Deliverables**:
- Schema hardening: 6 audit columns, 2 indexes, RPC enhanced (returns 11 columns)
- Infrastructure libraries: correlation.ts, idempotency.ts, rate-limiter.ts, emit-telemetry.ts
- Server actions: completeRatingSlip(), recoverSlipLoyalty(), manualReward()
- Direct service orchestration: RatingSlip → Loyalty (synchronous invocation)
- Saga recovery pattern for partial failures
- 41/41 unit tests passing, 13/13 quality gates passed

**Originally Planned (not implemented)**:
- Event listener registrations in LoyaltyService for:
  - `RATINGS_SLIP_COMPLETED` → `transaction_type = 'GAMEPLAY'`, `event_type = 'RATINGS_SLIP_COMPLETED'`.
  - `POINTS_UPDATE_REQUESTED` → `transaction_type = 'MANUAL_BONUS' | 'PROMOTION'`, `event_type = 'POINTS_UPDATE_REQUESTED'`.


**Quality Gates** (Actual):
- ✅ Schema hardening migration applied successfully
- ✅ RPC enhanced to return 11 columns with before/after snapshots
- ✅ All 4 infrastructure libraries created with 34/34 tests passing
- ✅ manualReward() with rate limiting (10 req/min) and idempotency
- ✅ completeRatingSlip() with saga recovery pattern
- ✅ Type safety: 0 TypeScript diagnostics errors
- ✅ 41/41 unit tests passing (100%)
- ⚠️ Integration tests deferred to Wave 3 (8-test suite documented)

### Wave 3 – Integration Testing + MTL UI — 8-10h ⏳ NEXT

**Status**: ⏳ **READY TO START**
**Kickoff**: [WAVE_3_KICKOFF.md](./wave-3/WAVE_3_KICKOFF.md)
**Prerequisites**: ✅ ALL MET - Wave 2 APIs functional, schema hardened, infrastructure complete

**Track 0: Integration Testing** (HIGH PRIORITY - deferred from Wave 2):
- 8-test integration suite for RatingSlip → Loyalty workflows
- Tests: Happy path, idempotency, manual rewards, rate limiting, performance, saga recovery, concurrency
- Coverage target: >85% for action code
- Must complete before production deployment

**Track 1: Permission Service Integration**:
- Replace permission placeholder with staff_permissions table integration
- Enforce loyalty:award capability for manualReward()
- Unit tests for authorization logic

**Track 2: MTL UI Implementation**:
- Transaction entry form with CTR threshold detection
- Compliance dashboard
- Loyalty widget (read-only consumption of loyalty data)

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ 8/8 integration tests passing
- ✅ Permission service integrated with RBAC
- ✅ MTL UI complete with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- ✅ Performance validated (<500ms for RatingSlip completion)
- ✅ 16/16 quality gates passed

## 6. Testing & Monitoring Strategy
- **Unit**: Calculation logic, ledger CRUD, RPC function (pgTAP or Supabase test harness).
- **Integration**: Supabase + server actions verifying both event-triggered and direct calls.
- **E2E**: Cypress/Playwright flow for manual reward followed by session close.
- **Observability**: Emit structured logs for each loyalty mutation using `{ event_type, player_id, session_id, delta_points, transaction_type, tier_before, tier_after }` so downstream dashboards stay consistent.
- **Backfill Validation**: SQL queries comparing legacy totals vs new `player_loyalty.current_balance` post-migration.
- **Operational Replay**: Maintain documented SQL/Supabase script to rebuild `player_loyalty` from `loyalty_ledger` for rollback drills.

---

## 7. Risk Mitigation
- **Schema Drift**: Lock migrations before Wave 1; any change requires rerunning idempotency/backfill scripts.
- **Event Ordering**: Use UPSERT + timestamps so duplicate/late events cannot double count.
- **Performance**: RPC indices on `player_loyalty.player_id`; monitor Supabase function latency during load testing.
- **Staff Tool Abuse**: Rate-limit `manualReward` action and require audit reason (enforced non-null).

---

## 8. Definition of Done (Phase 6)
1. LoyaltyService owns all point mutations and exposes `manualReward` & `calculateAndAssignPoints`.
2. RatingSlip no longer stores points data; emits telemetry event and consumes loyalty response.
3. `POINTS_UPDATE_REQUESTED` and manual pathway both produce ledger rows with correct metadata.
4. Idempotency validated for mid-session rewards (soft-success conflict handling).
5. `player_loyalty` is accurate after migrations and during real-time accruals.
6. MTL workflows operate against new loyalty APIs with automated tests in place.
7. Observability dashboards updated to monitor loyalty deltas post-launch.

---

## 9. Handoff Checklist
- [ ] Migration scripts merged and approved by DB owner.
- [ ] Loyalty service package published with documentation.
- [ ] RatingSlip + MTL teams trained on new APIs/events.
- [ ] Rollback plan documented (SQL/Supabase script to rebuild `player_loyalty` from `loyalty_ledger` deltas).
- [ ] Post-launch review scheduled (48h) to confirm zero drift between ledger and player balances.
