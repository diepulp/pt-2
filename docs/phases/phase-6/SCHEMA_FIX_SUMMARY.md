# Loyalty Service Schema Fix - Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Scope**: Phase 6 - Wave 1 Schema Correction

---

## Problem Statement

Wave 1 LoyaltyService implementation was developed against **outdated design documentation** that referenced:
- PascalCase table names (`LoyaltyLedger` instead of `loyalty_ledger`)
- Obsolete field names that didn't match the actual database schema
- Missing required fields (e.g., `transaction_type`, `source`, `event_type`)

The mismatch was caught during Wave 2 integration attempt, preventing deployment but avoiding production impact.

---

## Root Cause

1. Wave 1 implementation followed old design docs with outdated schema assumptions
2. `npm run db:types` was not run after Wave 0 schema changes
3. Stale `types/database.types.ts` allowed TypeScript to accept invalid field names
4. Runtime failures would have occurred on first database operation

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Types Regenerated

```bash
npm run db:types
```

Generated fresh `types/database.types.ts` from actual Supabase schema.

### 2. Table Name Corrections

| Incorrect (Wave 1) | Correct (Actual Schema) |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| `LoyaltyLedger` | `loyalty_ledger` |
| `PlayerLoyalty` | `player_loyalty` |

### 3. Field Name Corrections

#### player_loyalty Table

| Incorrect Field | Correct Field | Purpose |
|----------------|--------------|---------|
| `points_balance` | `current_balance` | Current redeemable points |
| `points_earned_total` | `lifetime_points` | Lifetime earned points (monotonic) |
| `points_redeemed_total` | ‚ùå REMOVED | Not in MVP schema |
| `tier_expires_at` | ‚ùå REMOVED | Tiers don't expire |
| `achievements` | ‚ùå REMOVED | Not in MVP scope |
| `benefits` | ‚ùå REMOVED | Stored in code (LOYALTY_TIERS) |
| `milestones` | ‚ùå REMOVED | Not in MVP scope |

#### loyalty_ledger Table

| Incorrect Field | Correct Field | Purpose |
|----------------|--------------|---------|
| `transaction_date` | `created_at` | Timestamp of transaction |
| `points` | `points_change` | Delta value (can be negative) |
| `direction` | ‚ùå REMOVED | Use `points_change` sign instead |
| `description` | `reason` | Human-readable description |
| `balance_after` | ‚ùå REMOVED | Calculated, not stored |
| `metadata` | ‚ùå REMOVED | Not in MVP scope |
| *missing* | `transaction_type` | GAMEPLAY, MANUAL_BONUS, etc. |
| *missing* | `event_type` | Domain event identifier |
| *missing* | `source` | system, manual, promotion, adjustment |
| *missing* | `session_id` | Idempotency key |
| *missing* | `rating_slip_id` | Link to RatingSlip context |

### 4. Files Updated

#### Service Layer
- ‚úÖ [services/loyalty/crud.ts](../../services/loyalty/crud.ts)
  - Fixed table name: `LoyaltyLedger` ‚Üí `loyalty_ledger`
  - Updated all DTOs to use correct field names
  - Updated all CRUD operations and SELECT queries

- ‚úÖ [services/loyalty/queries.ts](../../services/loyalty/queries.ts)
  - Updated all query operations to use correct field names
  - Changed filter from `direction` to `transactionType`

- ‚úÖ [services/loyalty/business.ts](../../services/loyalty/business.ts)
  - Updated `accruePointsFromSlip()` to use correct field mappings
  - Changed ledger creation to use `points_change`, `transaction_type`, `reason`
  - Updated player loyalty updates to use `current_balance`, `lifetime_points`

- ‚úÖ [services/loyalty/index.ts](../../services/loyalty/index.ts)
  - No changes needed (exports were already correct)

#### Documentation
- ‚úÖ [docs/LOYALTY_SERVICE_HANDOFF.md](../LOYALTY_SERVICE_HANDOFF.md)
  - Updated table references from PascalCase to snake_case
  - Corrected mermaid diagrams to use `loyalty_ledger`, `player_loyalty`

#### Tests
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: [__tests__/schema-verification.test.ts](../../__tests__/schema-verification.test.ts)
  - Compile-time verification that service DTOs match actual schema
  - Prevents future schema drift by catching mismatches during CI
  - Documents correct vs incorrect field names for future reference

---

## Verification

### TypeScript Compilation

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ No loyalty service errors
(Remaining errors are pre-existing RatingSlip issues from Wave 0)

### Schema Verification Test

```bash
npm test schema-verification
```

**Purpose**: Ensures service layer types stay in sync with database schema

---

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Automated Type Generation

Add to development workflow:

```bash
# After every migration
npm run db:types
git add types/database.types.ts
git commit -m "chore: regenerate database types"
```

### 2. Pre-commit Hook

Consider adding to `.husky/pre-commit`:

```bash
# Verify database types are fresh
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "supabase/migrations"; then
  echo "Migration detected - regenerating types..."
  npm run db:types
  git add types/database.types.ts
fi
```

### 3. CI/CD Integration

Add to GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Verify Schema Compliance
  run: |
    npm run db:types
    npm test schema-verification
    git diff --exit-code types/database.types.ts
```

### 4. Documentation Updates

‚úÖ Updated [docs/LOYALTY_SERVICE_HANDOFF.md](../LOYALTY_SERVICE_HANDOFF.md) to reflect actual schema
‚úÖ Created schema verification test as living documentation

---

## Timeline Impact

- **Wave 1 Status**: FIXED (was non-functional, now corrected)
- **Wave 2 Status**: UNBLOCKED (can now proceed with RatingSlip integration)
- **Estimated Fix Time**: 2.5 hours (schema analysis + code updates + testing)

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Fix Wave 1 schema issues
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è **NEXT**: Proceed with Wave 2 - RatingSlip ‚Üí Loyalty integration
3. üìã **RECOMMENDED**: Run schema verification test in CI pipeline
4. üìã **RECOMMENDED**: Add pre-commit hook for automatic type regeneration

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always regenerate types after schema changes** - Even if migrations don't directly touch your tables
2. **Design docs can become stale** - Verify against actual database schema, not documentation
3. **Catch mismatches at compile time** - Schema verification tests prevent runtime surprises
4. **Type generation is part of the workflow** - Should be automated, not manual
