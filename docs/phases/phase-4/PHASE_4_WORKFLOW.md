Week 4 Detailed Workflow - Player Management Feature

  I've created a comprehensive Week 4 execution workflow with systematic planning and parallel subagent delegation:

  ðŸ“Š Executive Summary

  Deliverable: Complete Player Management feature (VERTICAL slice)
  Duration: 15.5 hours (saves 1.5h via parallelization)
  Strategy: 4-wave execution with parallel Wave 2
  Quality Gates: 28 total across all waves

  ðŸŒŠ Wave Structure

  Wave 1: Server Actions (4h) - SEQUENTIAL

  - Agent: Backend Architect
  - Output: 6 player server actions (create, update, delete, get, list, search)
  - File: app/actions/player-actions.ts
  - Gates: 6 quality gates

  Wave 2: Hooks (1.5h) - PARALLEL ðŸš€

  This is the key optimization point

  Track A - Query Hooks (TypeScript Pro #1):
  - usePlayer (single player)
  - usePlayers (list with filters)
  - usePlayerSearch (search functionality)

  Track B - Mutation Hooks (TypeScript Pro #2):
  - useCreatePlayer
  - useUpdatePlayer
  - useDeletePlayer

  Time Savings: 3h sequential â†’ 1.5h parallel = 1.5 hours saved

  Wave 3: UI Components (6h) - SEQUENTIAL

  - Agent: Full-Stack Developer
  - Output: 4 React components
    - PlayerList (2h) - search, filter, pagination
    - PlayerForm (2h) - create/edit with validation
    - PlayerDetail (1h) - view details
    - PlayerDeleteDialog (1h) - confirmation dialog
  - Gates: 8 quality gates

  Wave 4: E2E Tests (4h) - SEQUENTIAL

  - Agent: Full-Stack Developer
  - Output: 18 comprehensive E2E tests
    - Create workflows (5 tests)
    - Read workflows (4 tests)
    - Update workflows (3 tests)
    - Delete workflows (3 tests)
    - Complete lifecycle (1 test)
    - Performance tests (2 tests)
  - Gates: 6 quality gates
