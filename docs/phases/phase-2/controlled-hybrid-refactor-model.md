Strategic Analysis: PT-1 Migration vs Vertical Slice TDD
Option A: Migrate PT-1 Player Service (4-6 hours)
Pros:
✅ Full feature set immediately - CRUD, search, queries, validation
✅ Battle-tested code - 90/100 score, production-proven
✅ Comprehensive error handling - Duplicate checks, constraint mapping, business logic
✅ Complete interfaces - All operations already defined
✅ Zod validation - Already integrated
✅ Reference implementation - Template for Visit, RatingSlip services
Cons:
❌ Technical debt import - 3 violations need immediate fixing
❌ Unknowns in dependencies - base.service.ts, @/types/database-rebuilt scope unclear
❌ Potential cascade issues - Fixing violations might break other services
❌ No iterative validation - Big bang integration, harder to debug
❌ Learning opportunity lost - Team doesn't internalize new patterns
Risk Profile:
🔴 High initial complexity - Must understand entire codebase first
🟡 Moderate debugging difficulty - If violations run deep, 4-6h → 12-16h
🟢 Low architectural risk - Core patterns are sound
Option B: Vertical Slice TDD (Current Approach)
Pros:
✅ Zero technical debt - Start clean, PRD-compliant from day 1
✅ Incremental validation - Each slice proves architecture works
✅ Learning path - Team internalizes patterns through practice
✅ Predictable velocity - Each slice takes 2-3 hours
✅ Fail fast - Issues surface early at small scale
✅ Documentation by example - Each slice shows "how to build services"
Cons:
❌ Slower feature delivery - Need 8-12 slices for full CRUD/search/queries
❌ Potential pattern drift - Each slice might introduce slight variations
❌ Reinventing wheels - PT-1 already solved search, validation, error mapping
Risk Profile:
🟢 Low technical risk - Small, testable increments
🟢 Low debugging difficulty - Issues isolated to current slice
🟡 Moderate opportunity cost - Could be building features instead
📊 QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON
Dimension	PT-1 Migration	Vertical Slice TDD
Time to Full Player Service	4-6h (best case)<br/>12-16h (if violations cascade)	16-24h (8 slices × 2-3h)
Time to Basic CRUD	4-6h	2-3h (already done!)
Technical Debt	Import 3 violations → fix later	0 violations
Learning Value	Low (copy/paste)	High (build understanding)
Template Quality	Battle-tested	Needs refinement
Risk of Failure	Medium (unknown deps)	Low (controlled)
Visit/RatingSlip Velocity	Fast (copy template)	Medium (apply learned patterns)
🎯 RECOMMENDATION: Hybrid Approach
Don't choose either/or - combine both strategies:
Phase 1: Continue TDD for Player CRUD (1 more slice - 2h)
✅ Already delivered: create()
🔄 Next slice: update() + duplicate email on update
Why: Validates update patterns, completes core CRUD
Phase 2: Strategic PT-1 Reference Migration (4h)
Don't blind copy - Use PT-1 as specification, not code source
Mine PT-1 for:
✅ Search query patterns (search.ts:108-160) - Multi-word search logic
✅ Error handling patterns (crud.ts:202-211) - Constraint violation mapping
✅ Validation schemas (reference only)
✅ Query optimization techniques (queries.ts:49-76) - JOIN patterns
Rewrite using PT-2 canonical architecture - Don't import violations
Write tests for each borrowed pattern
Phase 3: Pattern Documentation (1h)
Document Player service as canonical example
Create template: docs/patterns/SERVICE_TEMPLATE.md
Accelerate Visit/RatingSlip with proven playbook
⚖️ DECISION CRITERIA
Choose Pure PT-1 Migration IF:
❌ Deadline pressure (need Player done in <8 hours)
❌ Team already familiar with PT-1 codebase
❌ Willing to accept technical debt temporarily
❌ Have debugged base.service.ts and database-rebuilt already
Choose Pure Vertical Slice IF:
✅ You're here - Learning new architecture (PT-2 canonical)
✅ Quality > speed - Zero technical debt requirement
✅ Long-term maintainability priority
✅ Team needs to internalize patterns
Choose Hybrid (Recommended) IF:
✅ Want balance of speed and quality
✅ PT-1 has proven solutions worth preserving
✅ Can invest 2-3h upfront for 10-20h savings on Visit/RatingSlip
✅ Current situation - Already started TDD, have working foundation

Analyze PT-1 migration vs vertical slice TDD approach

Evaluate risk/reward tradeoffs for each strategy

Provide recommendation with justification
Week 1: Player Service (Hybrid)
├─ Day 1 (Done): TDD Slice 1 - create() ✅
├─ Day 2 (2h): TDD Slice 2 - update() + getById()
├─ Day 3 (4h): Strategic PT-1 Mining
│  ├─ Search module (rewrite using PT-2 patterns)
│  └─ Queries module (rewrite using PT-2 patterns)
└─ Day 4 (2h): Integration tests + documentation

Week 2: Visit Service (Accelerated)
└─ Use Player as template, 50% faster

Week 3: RatingSlip Service (Accelerated)
└─ Use proven patterns, 50% faster
Total Time:
Pure PT-1 Migration: 4-16h (high variance)
Pure Vertical Slice: 24-32h (low variance)
Hybrid: 8-10h Player + 12h Visit + 12h RatingSlip = 32h total (medium variance)
But Hybrid yields reusable template worth 20-30h on remaining 5 services.
🎬 FINAL ANSWER
Continue vertical slice TDD approach for 1 more slice (update()), then strategically mine PT-1 for complex patterns (search/queries) while rewriting them PRD-compliant. Rationale:
✅ You've already invested in TDD foundation - don't abandon
✅ Current minimal slice validates architecture - extend it
✅ PT-1 has valuable patterns, but violations are real - selective reuse safer than blind migration
✅ Hybrid builds canonical template for 5 remaining services
✅ Lower risk than big-bang migration with unknown dependency graph
Next Action: Complete update() slice (2-3h), then we can discuss mining PT-1 search patterns with fresh eyes and proven foundation.
