# PT-2 Architecture Gap Analysis

> **Date**: 2025-10-12
> **Context**: Phase 5 Complete - Player & Visit Features Delivered
> **Progress**: 62.5% Complete (Phases 0-5 of 8)
> **Purpose**: Track remaining architectural components for MVP production readiness
> **Strategy**: Hybrid Architecture (HORIZONTAL layers + VERTICAL delivery)

---

## Architecture Strategy

**Decision Framework**: [BALANCED_ARCHITECTURE_QUICK.md](../patterns/BALANCED_ARCHITECTURE_QUICK.md)

**Core Principle**: *"Horizontal layers for technical architecture, vertical slices for feature delivery"*

### Validated Pattern (Phases 3-5)

| Approach | When to Use | Timeline | Example | Status |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|--------|
| **HORIZONTAL** | ALL domains (>5 services) affected | 1-3 days | React Query setup, hook templates | ✅ Phase 3 Complete |
| **VERTICAL** | Single domain, user-facing feature | 1 week | Player Management, Visit Tracking | ✅ Phases 4-5 Complete |
| **HYBRID** | 2-3 domains, orchestration needed | 2-3 days | Visit lifecycle workflows | ⏳ Phase 7 Planned |

**Proven Efficiency**:
- Phase 3 (HORIZONTAL): 12 hours, 69 tests, 100% quality gates
- Phase 4 (VERTICAL): 15 hours, 22 tests, 100% quality gates
- Phase 5 (VERTICAL): 7 hours parallel, 26 tests, 100% quality gates
