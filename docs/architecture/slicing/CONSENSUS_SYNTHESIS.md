# PT-2 Architectural Slicing: Consensus Synthesis

> **Date**: 2025-10-09
> **Status**: Consensus Recommendation
> **Purpose**: Synthesize findings from 5 independent architect analyses
> **Decision**: Path D - Hybrid Model (Horizontal Layers + Vertical Delivery)

---

## Executive Summary

Five independent system architects analyzed PT-2's architectural slicing strategy from different perspectives:

1. **Horizontal Layering Analysis** - Technical layer structure
2. **Domain-Driven Vertical Analysis** - Bounded context boundaries
3. **Hybrid Strategy Analysis** - Complementary dimensions
4. **Risk & Migration Analysis** - Pragmatic path assessment
5. **MVP-Pragmatic Analysis** - Time-to-market optimization

**Unanimous Recommendation**: **Hybrid Model (Path D)**

**Core Principle**:
> "Horizontal layers for **technical architecture**, vertical slices for **feature delivery**"

**Consensus Timeline**: **8 weeks to production MVP** (vs 12 weeks pure vertical, 10 weeks strict horizontal)

**Risk Level**: **LOW** (builds on working foundation, zero rework)

**ROI**: **HIGHEST** among all alternatives

---

## 1. Areas of Strong Consensus

### 1.1 False Dichotomy Identified

**ALL 5 architects agree**: "Vertical vs Horizontal" is NOT either/or

**Quote from Hybrid Analysis**:
> "The perceived tension between 'vertical slicing' and 'horizontal layering' is a **false dichotomy**. PT-2 needs BOTH"

**Quote from Risk Analysis**:
> "Current horizontal service layer is **NOT a problem to solve** - it's a **foundation to build upon**"

**Quote from MVP Analysis**:
> "Keep horizontal **technical layers** (Service, Action, Hook, UI). Deliver vertical **feature slices** (Player week 1, Visit week 2, etc.)"

**Consensus**: Architecture uses horizontal structure, delivery uses vertical cadence

---

### 1.2 Current Foundation is Strong

**ALL 5 architects validated**:
- ✅ 7 services, 98/98 tests passing, >80% coverage
- ✅ Explicit interfaces (zero `ReturnType` inference)
- ✅ Typed dependencies (`SupabaseClient<Database>`)
- ✅ Functional factories (zero class-based services)
- ✅ Bounded context integrity
- ✅ 4x template velocity sustained
- ✅ Zero PRD violations

**Quote from Risk Analysis**:
> "7 services × 2 days rework = **14 days lost velocity** [for pure vertical restructure]"

**Consensus**: DO NOT restructure existing services

---

### 1.3 Recommended Implementation Sequence

**ALL 5 architects agree** on bottom-up + vertical delivery:

**Phase 1**: Service Layer Completion (Week 1)
- Complete MTL queries
- Add search/query modules only where proven necessary
- Integration testing

**Phase 2-4**: Vertical Slices (Weeks 2-6)
- Week 2-3: Player Management (complete DB → UI)
- Week 4-5: Visit Tracking (complete DB → UI)
- Week 6: RatingSlip Creation (complete DB → UI)

**Phase 5**: Real-Time Infrastructure (Week 7)
- Horizontal enhancement
- Domain hooks for subscriptions

**Phase 6**: Production Hardening (Week 8)
- Integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Deployment

**Consensus**: 8 weeks to production-ready MVP

---

### 1.4 Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**ALL 5 architects banned**:

❌ **Service-to-Service Calls**
- Quote: "Services NEVER call other services directly"
- Enforcement: Action layer orchestration only

❌ **Global Real-Time Managers**
- Quote: "PRD explicitly forbids global real-time managers"
- Alternative: Domain-specific hooks with cleanup

❌ **ReturnType Inference**
- Quote: "Explicit interfaces prevent coupling"
- Current: Zero violations, maintain standard

❌ **`any` Type Escapes**
- Quote: "Type safety is non-negotiable"
- Current: Zero violations, maintain standard

❌ **Class-Based Services**
- Quote: "Functional factories only"
- Current: 100% compliance

**Consensus**: These are quality gates that MUST NOT be compromised

---

## 2. Areas of Productive Tension

### 2.1 Module Granularity

**Horizontal Analysis**: Recommends 5 modules (crud, business, queries, transforms, validation)

**MVP Analysis**: Recommends 1 file per service until >500 lines

**Risk Analysis**: Acknowledges "current services <200 lines each"

**Resolution**: **Start with consolidated files, split when proven necessary**

**Trigger**: Service file exceeds 500 lines OR modules reused across 3+ operations

**Consensus**: YAGNI principle trumps premature abstraction for solo developer

---

### 2.2 Real-Time Priority

**Horizontal Analysis**: Phase 5 (Week 7) - Progressive enhancement

**Vertical Analysis**: Week 7 - Post-core features

**Hybrid Analysis**: Week 7 - Horizontal infrastructure layer

**MVP Analysis**: Post-MVP - "Manual refresh works"

**Risk Analysis**: Week 6-7 - Deferred until UI complete

**Resolution**: **Week 7 as progressive enhancement, NOT MVP blocker**

**Consensus**: Real-time is valuable but NOT launch-critical

---

### 2.3 Time to First UI Feature

**Horizontal Analysis**: Week 5 (after service + action layers complete)

**Hybrid/Risk Analysis**: Week 2-3 (Player slice)

**MVP Analysis**: **Day 1** (immediate vertical delivery)

**Resolution**: **Week 2-3 realistic for solo developer** (accounts for polish + testing)

**Consensus**: First working UI in 2-3 weeks, NOT 5 weeks

---

## 3. Unified Recommendation: Path D (Hybrid Model)

### 3.1 Architecture Structure

**Horizontal Dimension** (Technical Layers):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│       UI Layer (Client)              │  Components, Hooks, State
└───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                │ Server Actions
┌───────────────▼─────────────────────┐
│     ACTION Layer (Server)            │  Orchestration, Cache
└───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                │ Service Factories
┌───────────────▼─────────────────────┐
│    SERVICE Layer (Business)          │  CRUD, Business, Queries
└───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                │ Supabase Client
┌───────────────▼─────────────────────┐
│     DATA Layer (Database)            │  Schema, RLS, Triggers
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Purpose**: Separation of concerns, testability, clear boundaries

---

**Vertical Dimension** (Feature Delivery):

```
Player Management Feature:
├─ Data: player table + RLS
├─ Service: PlayerService.create()
├─ Action: createPlayerAction()
├─ Hook: useCreatePlayer()
└─ UI: PlayerForm component
→ COMPLETE in Week 2-3

Visit Tracking Feature:
├─ Data: visit table + lifecycle
├─ Service: VisitService.startVisit()
├─ Action: startVisitAction()
├─ Hook: useStartVisit()
└─ UI: VisitForm component
→ COMPLETE in Week 4-5
```

**Purpose**: User value, stakeholder demos, incremental delivery

---

### 3.2 Implementation Timeline (Consensus)

**Week 1: Service Layer Finalization**
- ✅ MTL queries complete
- Add business/query modules WHERE NEEDED (not all services)
- Integration testing
- Phase 2 audit

**Weeks 2-3: Player Management (First Vertical Slice)**
- Actions: create, update, delete
- Hooks: usePlayers, useCreatePlayer, useUpdatePlayer
- UI: PlayerList, PlayerForm, PlayerCard
- Tests: E2E player CRUD
- **DELIVERABLE**: Working Player Management UI ✅

**Weeks 4-5: Visit Tracking (Second Vertical Slice)**
- Actions: start, end, cancel visit
- Hooks: useVisits, useStartVisit, useEndVisit
- UI: VisitList, VisitForm, VisitTimeline
- Tests: E2E visit lifecycle
- **DELIVERABLE**: Working Visit Tracking UI ✅

**Week 6: RatingSlip Creation (Third Vertical Slice)**
- Actions: create, update, close
- Hooks: useRatingSlips, useCreateRatingSlip
- UI: RatingSlipForm, RatingSlipList
- Tests: E2E rating slip workflows
- **DELIVERABLE**: Working RatingSlip UI ✅

**Week 7: Real-Time Infrastructure (Horizontal)**
- useSupabaseChannel wrapper
- Batch invalidation scheduler
- Domain real-time hooks
- Memory leak prevention
- **DELIVERABLE**: Real-time synchronization ✅

**Week 8: Production Hardening**
- Cross-domain integration tests
- Bundle optimization
- Lighthouse CI (LCP ≤2.5s, TBT ≤200ms, JS ≤250KB)
- Deployment automation
- **DELIVERABLE**: Production MVP ✅

---

### 3.3 Core vs Domain Boundary (Consensus)

**Shared Infrastructure** (Horizontal):
- `services/shared/` - executeOperation, ServiceResult, error mapping
- `lib/supabase/` - Client factories (browser, server)
- `types/database.types.ts` - Canonical schema (generated)
- `components/ui/` - Pure presentational primitives
- `hooks/shared/` - useSupabaseChannel, batch invalidation

**Criteria**: Used by ALL domains without modification

---

**Domain Features** (Vertical):
- `services/<domain>/` - Business logic, DTOs, validation
- `app/actions/<domain>/` - Server actions, orchestration
- `hooks/<domain>/` - React Query hooks, real-time subscriptions
- `components/<domain>/` - Domain-specific UI components
- `__tests__/<domain>/` - Domain tests (unit, integration, E2E)

**Criteria**: Contains business rules for specific bounded context

---

### 3.4 Decision Criteria Summary

**Use Horizontal Layer Enhancement When**:
- ✅ Building infrastructure affecting ALL domains
- ✅ Standardizing cross-cutting concerns
- ✅ Type system evolution
- ✅ Testing infrastructure

**Use Vertical Feature Delivery When**:
- ✅ Delivering user-facing functionality
- ✅ Domain-specific business logic
- ✅ MVP feature prioritization
- ✅ Stakeholder demos

**Simple Rule**:
```
If touches 1 domain     → VERTICAL delivery
If touches ALL domains  → HORIZONTAL infrastructure
If user-facing          → VERTICAL delivery
If technical plumbing   → HORIZONTAL infrastructure
```

---

## 4. Rejected Alternatives (With Rationale)

### 4.1 Path B: Pure Vertical Slicing (Feature Directories)

**Risk**: HIGH
**Time to MVP**: 12 weeks
**ROI**: LOW

**Why Rejected** (Unanimous):

1. **8 weeks lost velocity** - Restructuring 7 working services
2. **CRUD duplication** - Each feature slice reimplements patterns
3. **No clear service boundary** - Loss of PlayerService contract
4. **98 tests invalidated** - Must migrate all tests
5. **Template velocity lost** - 4x improvement thrown away
6. **No pain point proven** - Services currently <200 lines each

**Quote from Risk Analysis**:
> "No evidence current services are too large (premature optimization)"

**When to Reconsider**:
- Service files exceed 500 lines
- More than 5 modules per service
- Team size >3 developers
- Feature independence validated

---

### 4.2 Path C: Strict Horizontal Layers (Formalized Structure)

**Risk**: MEDIUM
**Time to MVP**: 10 weeks
**ROI**: MEDIUM

**Why Deprioritized** (4 of 5 architects):

1. **Over-engineering** - Solo developer doesn't need rigid formalization
2. **Rigidity** - Harder to experiment with new patterns
3. **Boilerplate proliferation** - More files for theoretical future value
4. **YAGNI violation** - Building for 10-person team when solo
5. **Delayed value** - Week 5 to first UI (vs Week 2-3)

**Quote from MVP Analysis**:
> "Strict layer boundaries: Clean architecture vs more boilerplate. Decision: **Good Enough** for solo dev"

**When to Adopt**:
- Team size >3 developers
- Onboarding happening frequently
- Layer violations occurring
- Technical debt accumulating

---

## 5. Strategic Technical Debt (Consensus)

### 5.1 Debt to Accept for Speed

**ALL architects agree** on accepting these debts:

**Debt 1: Consolidated Service Files**
- Keep 1 file per service until >500 lines
- Paydown trigger: File exceeds 500 lines
- Paydown cost: 2 hours to split into modules
- Risk: LOW

**Debt 2: Inline Validation**
- Zod schemas in server actions, not separate validation.ts
- Paydown trigger: Schema reused across 3+ operations
- Paydown cost: 1 day to extract
- Risk: LOW

**Debt 3: Simple Error Messages**
- String messages, not error catalogs (enum)
- Paydown trigger: >10 unique error codes
- Paydown cost: 2 days to build catalog
- Risk: MEDIUM

**Debt 4: Manual Refresh**
- No real-time for MVP
- Paydown trigger: User feedback demands live updates
- Paydown cost: 5 days for real-time infrastructure
- Risk: LOW

**Debt 5: No Optimistic Updates**
- Server mutations with loading states
- Paydown trigger: User complaints about perceived slowness
- Paydown cost: 2 days per domain
- Risk: LOW

**Debt 6: Basic Lists (No Pagination)**
- Load all records
- Paydown trigger: Lists exceed 100 records
- Paydown cost: 1 day per domain
- Risk: MEDIUM

**Total Deferred Work**: ~19 days
**Immediate Time Saved**: ~22 days
**Net Benefit**: **3 days faster + deferred complexity**

---

### 5.2 Non-Negotiable Quality Gates

**ALL architects insist** on maintaining:

1. **Explicit Service Interfaces** - No ReturnType inference
2. **Typed Supabase Dependencies** - SupabaseClient<Database>
3. **ServiceResult Pattern** - Consistent error handling
4. **80% Test Coverage** - Service layer minimum
5. **Single Source of Truth** - database.types.ts canonical

**Rationale**: Zero incremental cost (already implemented), high protection value

---

## 7. Governance & Enforcement

### 7.1 Coupling Prevention

**Service-to-Service Calls**: BANNED
- Enforcement: Action layer orchestration only
- Monitoring: Code review, architecture tests

**Layer Boundary Violations**: ZERO TOLERANCE
- Enforcement: Type system + manual review
- Future: ESLint rules when team size >3

**Global State**: BANNED
- Enforcement: Functional factories only
- Current: 100% compliance

**Type Safety Erosion**: ZERO TOLERANCE
- Enforcement: TypeScript strict mode
- Current: Zero violations

---

### 7.2 Adaptation Triggers

**Trigger 1: Service Complexity**
- Condition: File >500 lines OR >5 modules
- Action: Split into feature-based modules
- Timeline: 2 hours per service

**Trigger 2: Team Growth**
- Condition: Team size >3 developers
- Action: Formalize layer contracts (Path C)
- Timeline: 2 days

**Trigger 3: Cross-Domain Complexity**
- Condition: >3 services needed per user action
- Action: Introduce workflow orchestration layer
- Timeline: 1 week

**Trigger 4: Performance Degradation**
- Condition: Actions >500ms p95 OR UI >3s load
- Action: Caching optimization, query tuning
- Timeline: 3 days

**Trigger 5: Testing Burden**
- Condition: Suite >10min OR maintenance >20% dev time
- Action: Re-balance pyramid (shift to integration)
- Timeline: 1 week

---

## 8. Rollback Strategies (Consensus)

**Action Layer Rollback**:
- Trigger: Performance issues, cache bugs
- Strategy: Revert to Server Components with direct service calls
- Impact: 2 days to stabilize
- Safeguard: Commit layers separately

**UI Layer Rollback**:
- Trigger: React Query integration fails
- Strategy: Fall back to SWR or Zustand
- Impact: 3 days to migrate
- Safeguard: Wrap React Query in custom hooks

**Real-Time Rollback**:
- Trigger: Memory leaks persist
- Strategy: Disable subscriptions, use polling
- Impact: 1 day to add fallback
- Safeguard: Real-time as progressive enhancement

**Complete Path Abandonment**:
- Trigger: Fundamental architecture flaw
- Strategy: Service layer + tests remain stable, redesign Action/UI
- Impact: 5 days to redesign
- Safeguard: Service layer independence
