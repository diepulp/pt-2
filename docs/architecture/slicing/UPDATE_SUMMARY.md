## Consistency Achieved

### Common Updates Across All Documents
1. **Progress**: 87.5% (7/8 services, MTL complete)
2. **Test Coverage**: 98/98 tests passing
3. **Dates**: All updated to 2025-10-10
4. **Strategy Reference**: All reference BALANCED_ARCHITECTURE_QUICK.md
5. **Terminology**: Consistent use of HORIZONTAL/VERTICAL/HYBRID labels
6. **Week Rhythm**: All show same pattern (HORIZONTAL setup → VERTICAL features → HORIZONTAL hardening)

### Alignment with Decision Framework

All documents now consistently apply the decision rules from [BALANCED_ARCHITECTURE_QUICK.md](../../patterns/BALANCED_ARCHITECTURE_QUICK.md):

| Scenario | Approach | Documents Aligned |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| React Query setup (ALL services) | HORIZONTAL | ✅ All 3 docs |
| Player Management UI (single domain) | VERTICAL | ✅ All 3 docs |
| Visit start flow (Player + Casino + Visit) | HYBRID | ✅ All 3 docs |
| Real-time infrastructure (ALL domains) | HORIZONTAL | ✅ All 3 docs |
| Performance hardening (ALL domains) | HORIZONTAL | ✅ All 3 docs |

## Impact on Planning

### Before Update
- Mixed messaging about vertical vs horizontal approaches
- Unclear when to use each strategy
- No explicit week-by-week rhythm
- Excessive documentation (1400+ lines to read)

### After Update
- **Clear decision framework**: BALANCED_ARCHITECTURE_QUICK.md (10-min read)
- **Explicit week labels**: Every week marked as HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL
- **Rationale included**: Why each approach was chosen
- **Success metrics**: Separate criteria for HORIZONTAL vs VERTICAL
- **Consistent story**: All docs tell same story with same terms

## Decision Framework in Action

### Example 1: State Management (Week 2)
**Question**: How to add React Query?
**Answer**: HORIZONTAL
**Rationale**: Affects ALL domains, enables ALL vertical UI slices
**Timeline**: 2 days infrastructure → ready for weeks 3-5

### Example 2: Player UI (Week 3)
**Question**: How to build Player Management?
**Answer**: VERTICAL
**Rationale**: Single domain, user-facing, complete DB→UI
**Timeline**: 1 week full-stack delivery

### Example 3: Visit Start Flow
**Question**: How to coordinate Player + Casino + Visit?
**Answer**: HYBRID (Action orchestration)
**Rationale**: 2-3 domains, orchestration needed
**Timeline**: 2-3 days in Week 4

## Success Metrics Tracking

### HORIZONTAL Metrics
- ✅ Service layer: 7/8 complete (87.5%)
- ✅ Test coverage: >80% across ALL services
- ⏳ State management: React Query adoption (Week 2)
- ⏳ Real-time: <1s latency across ALL domains (Week 6)
- ⏳ Performance: LCP ≤2.5s on ALL pages (Week 7)

### VERTICAL Metrics

- ⏳ Visit feature: 100% functional (Week 4)
- ⏳ RatingSlip feature: 100% functional (Week 5)
- ⏳ Each feature: Independently deployable

### Framework Adoption
- ✅ BALANCED_ARCHITECTURE_QUICK.md created
- ✅ All roadmap docs updated
- ⏳ Team using framework for decisions
- ⏳ ADRs documenting HORIZONTAL vs VERTICAL choices

## Next Actions

### For Team
1. **Review** BALANCED_ARCHITECTURE_QUICK.md (10 minutes)
2. **Use decision tree** when planning work
3. **Label commits** with HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL
4. **Document decisions** in ADRs when non-obvious

### For Documentation
1. **Update SESSION_HANDOFF.md** with hybrid strategy reference (Week 3)
2. **Create ADRs** for upcoming decisions (state management, real-time)
3. **Track metrics** weekly (HORIZONTAL vs VERTICAL progress)
