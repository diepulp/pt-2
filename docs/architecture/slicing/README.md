## Overview

This directory contains the complete architectural slicing analysis for PT-2, produced by deploying five independent system architect agents to explore different strategies and synthesize consensus recommendations.

**Key Decision**: **Path D - Hybrid Model** (Horizontal layers + Vertical delivery)

**Timeline**: **8 weeks to production MVP**

**Confidence**: **HIGH** (unanimous recommendation across 5 analyses)

### 3. Independent Architect Analyses

These are the detailed reports from each of the 5 specialized system architects:

#### 3.1 [HORIZONTAL_LAYERING_ANALYSIS.md](./HORIZONTAL_LAYERING_ANALYSIS.md)

**Architect Focus**: Technical layer structure, separation of concerns

**Key Contributions**:
- 4-layer architecture (Data → Service → Action → UI)
- Bottom-up sequencing rationale
- Testing pyramid (60% unit, 30% integration, 10% E2E)
- Cross-layer communication patterns
- Real-time strategy (UI layer, not Service layer)

**Recommendation**: Adopt layers, defer formalization until team growth

**Timeline**: 10 weeks (strict horizontal first)

---

#### 3.2 [DOMAIN_DRIVEN_VERTICAL_ANALYSIS.md](./DOMAIN_DRIVEN_VERTICAL_ANALYSIS.md)

**Architect Focus**: Bounded context boundaries, domain isolation

**Key Contributions**:
- 5 vertical slice boundaries (Player, Casino, Visit, RatingSlip, PlayerFinancial)
- Sequencing strategy (Player/Casino parallel, then Visit, then RatingSlip/Finance)
- Integration patterns (Action layer orchestration, no service-to-service calls)
- Cross-cutting concern handling (horizontal at each layer)

**Recommendation**: Domain-level slices (not feature-level), Action orchestration

**Timeline**: 7 weeks (vertical slices in sequence)

---

#### 3.3 [HYBRID_STRATEGY_ANALYSIS.md](./HYBRID_STRATEGY_ANALYSIS.md)

**Architect Focus**: Complementary dimensions, pragmatic balance

**Key Contributions**:
- Resolved false dichotomy (horizontal AND vertical, not OR)
- Core vs Domain boundary criteria
- 8-week hybrid implementation roadmap
- Practical folder structure
- ESLint enforcement patterns (future)

**Recommendation**: Horizontal for tech, vertical for delivery ✅ **CONSENSUS CHOICE**

**Timeline**: 8 weeks (hybrid model)

---

#### 3.4 [RISK_AND_MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md](./RISK_AND_MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md)

**Architect Focus**: Risk assessment, migration paths, rollback plans

**Key Contributions**:
- Path comparison matrix (A/B/C/D)
- Migration cost quantification (8 weeks lost for pure vertical)
- Adaptation triggers (when to reconsider)
- Decision tree for future evolution
- Rollback strategies per phase

**Recommendation**: Path D (Hybrid) - lowest risk, highest ROI ✅ **CONSENSUS CHOICE**

**Timeline**: 8 weeks (incremental, low-risk)

---

#### 3.5 [MVP_PRAGMATIC_ANALYSIS.md](./MVP_PRAGMATIC_ANALYSIS.md)

**Architect Focus**: Time-to-market, YAGNI, solo developer optimization

**Key Contributions**:
- YAGNI audit (55 days saved by skipping premature abstractions)
- Strategic debt acceptance framework
- Solo developer context switching analysis
- Day-by-day 4-week roadmap (aggressive timeline)
- Good Enough vs Perfect trade-off matrix

**Recommendation**: Immediate vertical delivery, defer abstractions

**Timeline**: 4 weeks (optimistic, assumes aggressive cuts)

**Note**: Consensus adjusted to 8 weeks for realistic solo developer pace with testing + polish

---

## Key Findings Summary

### Unanimous Consensus (5/5 Architects)

✅ **Path D (Hybrid Model)** recommended by all
✅ **False dichotomy resolved** - horizontal AND vertical are complementary
✅ **Current foundation is strong** - 7 services, 98 tests, zero PRD violations
✅ **DO NOT restructure** - build on working base, avoid rework
✅ **8 weeks to MVP** - realistic timeline for production-ready
✅ **Service-to-service calls BANNED** - Action layer orchestration only
✅ **Explicit interfaces NON-NEGOTIABLE** - Type safety maintained

---

### Areas of Productive Tension (Resolved)

⚠️ **Module Granularity**:
- Horizontal: 5 files per service
- MVP: 1 file until >500 lines
- **Resolution**: Start consolidated, split when proven necessary

⚠️ **Real-Time Priority**:
- Horizontal/Hybrid/Risk: Week 7 (progressive enhancement)
- MVP: Post-MVP (manual refresh sufficient)
- **Resolution**: Week 7 as enhancement, NOT MVP blocker

⚠️ **Time to First UI**:
- Horizontal: Week 5
- Hybrid/Risk: Week 2-3
- MVP: Day 1 (aggressive)
- **Resolution**: Week 2-3 (realistic for solo dev with testing)

## Architectural Decision

### Core Principle

> "Horizontal layers for **technical architecture**, vertical slices for **feature delivery**"

### Structure

**Horizontal Dimension** (Technical Layers):
```
Data Layer      → Schema, RLS, migrations
Service Layer   → Business logic, DTOs, validation
Action Layer    → Server actions, orchestration, cache
UI Layer        → Components, hooks, state management
```

**Vertical Dimension** (Feature Delivery):
```
Player Feature   → DB → Service → Action → Hook → UI (Week 2-3)
Visit Feature    → DB → Service → Action → Hook → UI (Week 4-5)
RatingSlip Feature → DB → Service → Action → Hook → UI (Week 6)
```

### Core vs Domain Boundary

**Shared Infrastructure** (Horizontal):
- `services/shared/` - executeOperation, ServiceResult, error mapping
- `lib/supabase/` - Client factories
- `types/database.types.ts` - Canonical schema
- `components/ui/` - Pure presentational primitives

**Criteria**: Used by ALL domains without modification

---

**Domain Features** (Vertical):
- `services/<domain>/` - Business logic, DTOs
- `app/actions/<domain>/` - Server actions
- `hooks/<domain>/` - React Query hooks
- `components/<domain>/` - Domain UI

**Criteria**: Contains business rules for specific bounded context

---

## Strategic Technical Debt

### Debt to Accept (For Speed)

✅ **Consolidated Service Files** - 1 file until >500 lines (save 3 days)
✅ **Inline Validation** - No separate validation.ts (save 3 days)
✅ **Simple Error Messages** - Strings, not catalogs (save 3 days)
✅ **Manual Refresh** - No real-time for MVP (save 5 days)
✅ **No Optimistic Updates** - Server mutations only (save 3 days)
✅ **Basic Lists** - No pagination until >100 records (save 3 days)

**Total Deferred**: ~19 days
**Immediate Savings**: ~22 days
**Net Benefit**: 3 days faster + deferred complexity

**Paydown**: 2 weeks post-MVP (documented, budgeted)

---

### Non-Negotiable Quality Gates

❌ **Explicit Service Interfaces** - NO ReturnType inference
❌ **Typed Supabase Dependencies** - SupabaseClient<Database>
❌ **ServiceResult Pattern** - Consistent error handling
❌ **80% Test Coverage** - Service layer minimum
❌ **Single Source of Truth** - database.types.ts canonical

**Rationale**: Zero incremental cost (already implemented), high protection value

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 2 Completion (Week 1)
- ✅ 7/7 services with explicit interfaces
- ✅ 110+ tests passing
- ✅ >80% coverage per service

### Phase 3 Delivery (Weeks 2-6)
- ✅ 3 complete vertical slices
- ✅ Working UI for each domain
- ✅ E2E tests passing
- ✅ Server actions <500ms p95
- ✅ React Query cache hit >70%

### Phase 4 Real-Time (Week 7)
- ✅ Updates <1s latency
- ✅ Zero memory leaks
- ✅ Multi-tab sync working

### Production Ready (Week 8)
- ✅ Lighthouse: LCP ≤2.5s, TBT ≤200ms, JS ≤250KB
- ✅ Zero security advisor warnings
- ✅ Deployment automated

## Quick Decision Guide

**Question 1: What is the scope?**
- Single domain + user-facing → **VERTICAL**
- ALL domains + infrastructure → **HORIZONTAL**
- 2-3 domains + user-facing → **HYBRID (Action layer)**

**Question 2: How complex?**
- <500 lines → **VERTICAL (inline)**
- >500 lines → **Consider module split or HORIZONTAL**

**Question 3: How risky?**
- Low risk (single domain) → **VERTICAL**
- High risk (system-wide) → **HORIZONTAL (phased rollout)**

**Question 4: How urgent?**
- MVP feature (stakeholder demo) → **VERTICAL**
- Infrastructure (foundational) → **HORIZONTAL**

**Default**: When in doubt, **VERTICAL delivery** (ship features, defer abstractions)

---

## Rollback Strategies

**Action Layer Rollback**:
- Trigger: Performance issues
- Strategy: Revert to Server Components
- Impact: 2 days

**UI Layer Rollback**:
- Trigger: React Query fails
- Strategy: Fall back to SWR
- Impact: 3 days

**Real-Time Rollback**:
- Trigger: Memory leaks
- Strategy: Disable subscriptions, polling
- Impact: 1 day

**Complete Path Abandonment**:
- Trigger: Fundamental flaw
- Strategy: Service layer stays stable, redesign Action/UI
- Impact: 5 days
